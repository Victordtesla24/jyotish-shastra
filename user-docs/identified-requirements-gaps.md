# Identified Frontend Implementation Gaps

Based on an analysis of the `client/` directory, the following implementation gaps have been identified in the React application:

## 1. Architectural Violations

- **Monolithic `ChartPage.js` Component:** The `ChartPage.js` component is overly complex and handles state management, form logic, API calls, and rendering for multiple views. This violates the single-responsibility principle and makes the component difficult to maintain and test.
- **Bypassed Service Layer:** The frontend makes direct `fetch` calls within `ChartPage.js`, ignoring the abstracted service layer (`analysisService.js`, `chartService.js`). This practice tightly couples the UI with the API and prevents code reuse.
- **Lack of State Management:** The application relies exclusively on `useState` for all state, including server state. This is inadequate for a data-driven application and does not align with the documented architecture, which specifies `React Query` for managing server state, caching, and asynchronous operations.

## 2. Component and UI Deficiencies

- **Missing Reusable Components:** The detailed views for comprehensive and basic analysis are embedded directly in `ChartPage.js`. This logic should be extracted into smaller, reusable components to improve modularity and readability.
- **Inadequate Form Handling:** The birth data form lacks a robust validation library like `React Hook Form`, which is specified in the project's technology stack. The current implementation has minimal client-side validation, leading to a suboptimal user experience.
- **Subpar User Experience:**
  - Loading and error states are handled with simple text messages instead of dedicated, user-friendly components.
  - The UI lacks a cohesive design and could be improved with better styling and layout.

## 3. Missing Functionality

- **No Centralized Routing Logic:** While basic routes are defined in `App.js`, there is no centralized mechanism for managing navigation or protecting routes.
- **Incomplete Component Integration:** The existing components, pages, and services are not fully integrated, leading to a disconnected user experience.
- **No Testing:** There are no unit or integration tests for the frontend components, which is a critical gap in a production-ready application.

## 4. Adherence to Project Standards

- **Vedic Astrological Accuracy:** The frontend must be carefully reviewed to ensure all data is displayed in a manner that is consistent with the backend's calculations and Vedic astrology principles.
- **Production-Ready Code:** The codebase needs significant refactoring to meet production standards, including the removal of hardcoded API endpoints and the implementation of proper error handling and logging.
