## 3. Methodological Framework

### 3.1 BPHS-Based Methodologies Implemented

#### Primary Methods
1. **Praanapada Method** (Highest Accuracy - 40% weight)
   - Aligns birth ascendant with Praanapada calculations
   - Uses Sun position + birth time in palas
   - BPHS constants: 1 hour = 2.5 palas, 1 pala = 60 padas

2. **Moon Position Method** (High Accuracy - 30% weight)
   - Moon sign conjunction with ascendant verification
   - Trine and quadrant relationship analysis
   - Nakshatra and pada considerations

3. **Gulika Position Method** (Medium Accuracy - 20% weight)
   - Gulika (son of Saturn) position verification
   - Day-of-week dependent calculations
   - Saturn position as reference point

4. **Event Correlation Method** (Variable Accuracy - 10% weight)
   - Life events correlation with dasha periods
   - Career, marriage, education event matching
   - Confidence depends on event quality and quantity

### 3.2 Confidence Scoring System
- **Base confidence**: 30%
- **Method alignment**: Up to 40% additional
- **Multi-method agreement**: Up to 20% additional
- **Consistency check**: Up to 10% additional
- **Maximum confidence**: 100%

### 3.3 Time Candidate Generation
- **Range**: ±2 hours from estimated birth time
- **Interval**: 5-minute increments (49 total candidates)
- **Scoring**: Each candidate scored across all enabled methods
- **Selection**: Highest composite score determines rectified time
