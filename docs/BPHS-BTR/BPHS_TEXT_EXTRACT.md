Preface
Presentedherewithwith pleasureis the first-everEnglish
translationof the full text of the availableversionof Maharshi
parasara'sBrihat ParasaraHora.sastra. But for the blessings
of Lor<iGanesathis would havebeenas uphill task forme'
Sri Maha Vishnu is the god f gods.So is ParasaraHora-
the book of books in the field of astrology.
The work is in the form of a carritch betweensageParaqara
and his disciple Maitreya who later himself becamea worthy
sage.Parasarabelongingto Vasishta'slineagewas Veda Vyara's
faitrer. As coulclbe seelrin the courseof progressingth-orugh
li. t.*,, sage Saunaka was the preccptorof Parasarain the
lnatter of aitrotogy. Saunakawas one of the earliest sagesand
was Garga'sdisciPle.
Thi dateof parasaracould be attributedto be roughly the
efa of Dharma Raja of Maha Bharata' This can be understood
when the sagestates"in the presentYuga, Dharma Raja is born
with the combination of..." He further statesthat Salivahana
;*itr u, born with the samecombination...'Further,the reader
could find statementsrelatingto the horoscopicyogasof Maha
Vitttou, Prajapati, Swayambhu Manu etc' which statement
could possiblybe madeby no ordinary-mortal'
Varaha-Mihira in Brihat Samhita, Kalyana Varma tn
Saravaliand many such other illustrious authorsgavereferences
df ?arasara'sastrologicalstatements'
ParasaraHora finds its translation ih Bengali,Malayalam
etc. which translationshoweverhave not beensoenby me' I
have with me the following versions'
1. Sri VenkateswataPress,Bombay,partly renderedin Hindi'
For a msjority of slokas,one can find Sanskritcommen'
tary only.

-- 9 of 482 --

r l
2. Hindi translation by Suaram Jha. (Master Khelari Lal,
Varanasiedition)
3. Hindi transtation by Devachandra Jha (Chaukambha
edi.tion)
4. Hindi transhfion by GanesaDatta Pathak(Thakur prasad
edition)
Afterrcrutinizing critically the .four manuscripts,I .have
for ieasona of more credibility chosen the Sanskritversion
renderedby SitararmJha. Thc Chaukambhaversionis almost
the sameas that of Khelari Lal's.
Othcr versionsthat I havecomeacrossare :
l. Tamil translation by C. G. Rajan-for only 36 cbapters,
without SanskritI'erses.
2. English translationby N. N..K. Rao for only 25 chapters,
witbout Sanskritslokas.
Thus, I have felt a neid to make the original version
avallablein Englishto the fullest possibleextent. Our version
has 97 cbapterscontaining English translationand exhaustive
alnotations and exanrples.
To handlethe publicationeasily,we havedividedthe work
in two volumes.The presentvolume-first volume-contains 45
cbapterswhile the remaining52 chaptershave beenput in the
secondvolume.
Chapter I and chapter 2 give some. preliminary extra-
astrological information. From chapter 3, tho astiological
information begins. , In tbis chapter, phnetary descriptions,
benefics aod malefics, planetary deities, complexions, s"*,
primordial compounds,seasons,relationships,dignitiesetc. uri
given. Methodsof calcuratingthe'5 upagrahas rike Dhooma
and Muburta velas like Gulika are given. Theseare totally ten
and have thcir own say on a nativity, as the other nine Lain
Grabas have. so to say, these upagrahasand Muhurta vela5
can alter in suitebh proportions the effectsduc to Nava crauai

In tho matter of calculation of Gullka, a different concept comes
to light from this oldestwork. The latcr authorshavegivenan
altogether variable in knowing Gulika's position whereas
Perasara advised that it should be cast for the beginnin! of
Saturn's Muhurta. Whoreas somesuggestthat it should be for
the endingMuhurta of Saturn.
In chapter4, each Rasi is describedfrom variousangles.
Slokas 25-30 are the climax of this chapter. An unerring
method to find out the Nisheka Lagna (or the moment of
intercoursecausingconception)from the time ofl birth is outlined.
Though the prooess of calculation is as simple as a school
student's mathematical quiz, it hasgreat truth in it which even
modern science could not discover. To provo the truth of the
statementin the sago'sinstruction, a practicai examplehas been
given by me. An assumed exanrple cannot better solve the
probfem. A practical case where the time of coitus is astrologi-
call;r chosenis taken in hand; time of birth has also beengot
accuratelynotod. From the tinro of birth, the time of Nisheka
(or of coitus)is traced which is not in variation, evento the
slightest extont,with the originallynoted Nishekatime. Again
from the time of Nisheka,the birth time is tracedin a forward
manner using only traditional rules of astrology. This exercise
provesthreeimportant points, viz.
l. The point of M.C. is to bc found out in the mtal horos-
cope aod housesintersectedaccordingly. This is popularly
called Sripati Paddhati. Originally Parasaraqdvocatedthis
system.
2. Gulika's position should be found out for the bcginningof
Saturn'gMuhurta only.
3. Lahiri's Ayanamsais the first best. The reader will find
that we have used Moon's exsct longitude in the abovc
prqcess. Simple angular distanceby any Ayanamsawill
not elter the solution, but a slight change in Moon's
. poeition will take us fer away from the truth. With lahiri's
.Ayanamsa,we can safely work out even Nadiamsas,which
ohangefast,

The method given by me in working out the future birth
time from the time of coition can very well help the astrologers
to foretell the exact momentof birth from the time of query.
Reseaches	revealthat time of query hasa perfectalignmentwith
the time of Nisheka.
Chapter5 toucht-isvarious special lagnas, tike Ghatika
Lagna, Hora Lagna and BhavaLagna. The importanceof these
ascendansscannot be . underestimated. A final Bhava chart can
emergeafter merging the different bhava charts causedby these
various special ascendants. This final bhava chart can only
revealthe extent of planetaryeffects when consideredhousew.se
whereasthe bhava chart exclusivelypreparedon natal ascendant
alone can sometimes mislead. This is what the sageemphasises
ln sloka 9.
Cqme to chapter6. The zodiacis dividedin to sixteen
Vargasor divisions. Theseare called ShodasaVargas. How to
find out such Vargasand thcir use are fully explained. These
are from Rasi down to Shashtiamsa. In the classification,the
vargasare made in four groups' i.e. 6 vargas,T Vargas,10 Vargas
and 16 Vargas and special technical names havebeon given for
the total number of desirablevargasa planet attainedfor easy
identification. For example if a planet is said to be in Golo'
kamsa,it indicatesthat out of 16 Vargas,it is in l5 good V:rrgas.
Thesetechnicalnamesappearin the gradationof Raja Yogas.
Each Varga findsa certain specificusein preferencoto a
planet's Rasi position. For example,without consideringthe
Dvadasamsachart no tangibleresuitsdue to the native'sparents
can be known. In decidingone'scareer,the Dasamsapositions
of the planetsare of supremeimportance. Theseare highlighted
in chapter7. In this very chapter the sage enunciateswhat is
called Vimsopaka strengthof a planet. He assignsa maximum
. of 20 pointstaking againdifferentlythe four Vargaclassifications,
. viz. Shadvarga, SaptaVarga, Dasa Varga and ShodasaVarga.
The considerationhere is whether a planet is placedin own sign,
, friendly sign, encmy'ssign and the like in the concerncdVarga
scheme. Ihen an eveluatonis done to get Vimsopakastrength.
This strength enablesus decidethe extent of auspiciouseffectsa
planet will be capableof revealingin'a dasa.

Chapter8 dealswith what is calledJaimini aspectson Rasi
basis. Maharshi Jaimini was the sage who expanded these
Parasari principles very extonsively in Sutra form for easy
nemorization and successfulapplicability. The original concept
is howeverfrom the pen of Parasara.
Childhoodevilsare discussedin chapter9 whiie chapter10
prescribesplanetarycombinationsto combat zuch possibleevils.
Basic information about the 12 housescould be f<rundin
chapter I I while specificattentionmay be given to slokas 14-16.
Thesc 3 slokasservean important key in knowing how a Bhava
is going to give effectsunder various circumstances.
Chapters12-23givea varietyof information and instruc-
tions in analysingthe 12 housesof a horoscopein a systematic
manner. A closo study of theserules will tame one'smind to
scientiflcallyapproach the horoscopefor fruitful resuts.
Chapter'24is again one of the most important chapters.
Here, the various effectsof a Bhava lord being in a specifichouse
are given. All tho 12 lords are fully covered. How to Eortout
a situation in case of contrary indicationsis given in slokas
145-148.
The bhavaeffectsof Dhooma,Vyatipata,Gulika ctc.. are
narratedfully in chapter2.5. PranapadaLagna's positionvis-a-
vis natal ascendantalso revealscertain specialeffectsas could be
seenin this very chapter.
Shadbalacalculations,Ishtaand Kashta phalasand other
related mathematicalaspectsare elaboratelylaid down in the 3
chapters,viz. 26,27 and 28.
It is not in order if planetsarp studiedwith referenceto
merenatal chart. Padasfor varioushouseswill furfher alter the
planetary sffects.This is what is taugbtin chapter 29. Raja
Yogas, inter alia are best analysedthrough Arudha chart or Pada
chart. The sage suggestsGrahaPadasas well, but u0fortuna-
tely he leavesit at that without addingmuch information.'
For still deeper research,Upapadawill be more effective.
This areawill give moie cluesparticularly about marriage,financo
and.diseases.Seechapter30.
Chapter3l entitled'Argaladhyaya'though brief hasworthy
information on planetary interventions, obstructionsand effects
thereo).

Significanceof planetsis treatedin chapter32.
Karakamsa is the Navamsa Rasi occupiedby Atma
Karaka. Plenetsforming a certainrelationshipwith Karakamsa
and their effects are narrated in chapter33 extending to 99
slokas.
Chapter 34 is againone of the most instructive. Planets
.assumea certaintendencyby virtue of owninga certainhouse.
The sageelaborately touchessuch roles for various planetsfor
all the 12 ascendants. He decideson such principlesthe Yoga
Karakas,Voga Bhanga,Karakasand Marakas for eachascendant'
This will enable us undentand whelher planet will give bene'
ficial resuttsor adverseeffects.Death dealing planetsor Mrakas
allow us to guessthe period of one'sdeath,
' .d,sthe name implies, chapter35 lists NabhasaYogas which
are availableln most stlndard texts. Many new Raja Yogas
could be found in chapter 36, like Khadga, Mridanga, Chamara,
Kahala etc.
Chapters!7 and38 deal with Lunar and Solar yogaswhich
are popularly known. Raja yogas in chapter 39' Yogas for
royai associationin chapter40, and financial combinationsin
chapter 41 desorvelpecial nention, containing a vapiety of
authoritativeinformatidn
Maraka or deathdealingplanetshavea say on the finances
of the native apart from causing his end' Theseare tersely
entightenedin the 42nd chaPter.
The chapter on longevity,bearing No' 43, is among the
rnost important onss. Pindaytr, Naisargayu,Amsayu and the
like, and computations besed on ascendant/planetarypairs
linking with movable, fixcd and common signs containinstruc-
tive information. If, thp notes,I havetakenPindayucalculations
and worked out a fullfledged example touching all aspectsof
co$putation. I haveadopteda scientificmethodfor deductions
for planetarycontributions arising by placement in bhaias 12
to 7. I havb simply not considered bhava positions
in these deductions but degree-wisepositions of the various
planeti. I have given onecommon formula covering the six
bhavasand the readercan work out the exact lossof longevity.
This can be usefully extened to any loss of years as far as

-- 14 of 482 --

1 6
bhavas12to 7 is concernedin othcr systemlas well. Other
tongevitycalculationshavebeen suitablyannotatedby me.
The readerwill also do well to studychapter44 concerning
Marakas beforehe takesa decisionon longevity. Rahu/Ketu
havealsobeenassignedMarakatwaroles.
The concludingchapterof Vol I is the 45th dealingwith a
number of kinds of Avasthasof the planets' Out of these,tbe
12 Avasthas,known as SayanadiAvasthasare of supremeimpor-
tance. If one tries to interpret theseAvasthasin proper spirit,
he will be ableto detect the diseasesthe nativewill suffer. I
have supported niy views with the help of information from
Adbhuta Sug"ru of Ballala Senaand Hora Ratna of Balabhadra.
For example,if Mars is in Agamanavastha,one will suffer fronr
deepear pains, . In the normal parlance,we consideronly Jupiter
in ine context of ear defects. Diseasesof hand and foot are
assignedto venus in Agamanavastha. If one conductsa scien'
tific researchin the matter of diseaseswith the help of planetary
Avasthas,viz. Sayanadi Avasthas,one is bound to reachmany
brilliant clues.
The presentwork offersa vact scopefor suc@ssin predic'
tive astrology. One can build up his own applied astrology
insteadof theoreticalastrologyif he works on the linessuggested
by MaharshiParasara.
A word of cautionis nccessaryfor the benefitofthe reader,
In order to understand the hidden aspectsof the variousrules
given herein, what is required is a thorough understandingof
theseprinciples. Skipping over fast to an ensuingchaptermay
not convey the real ideaof a 'present' chapter. To make the
reader's Job easier,I have explained every difficult aspect as
clearly as I understandbasedon my own experienceand study of
other authoritative texts'
In the end, I would like to mention that my attempt to
translatethis greatwork andannotatemay not havebeenwholly
successful. I surely would have left some shortcomingsunno-
ticed and unrectified. From the readers,I can onlT expectthe
afrectionof forgiving me for any innocent lapses.

while the rest are benefics.Mercury, however,is a malefrcif he

Notes : That decreasingMoon and increasingMoon are
.respectivelya malefic and a beneficis the view conveyedby the
sage.Yct some exponentsand comrnentatorshold the following
view :
When the Moon is aheadof the Sun but within 120",
she has medium strength. Between l20o to 240' she is very
auspicious, ssg qfffiIrlnii]. From 240" to 0" she is bereft of
, strength. This is Yavanas' view, vide P. 70 of my English
Trunslationof Saravali. This view is, however, relatedto the'
Moon's strength or otherwise, while waning Moon (Krishna
Paksha or dark half Moon) is a malefic and waxing Moon
(Sukla Pakshaor bright half Moon) is a benefic.
Should the Moon be conjunct a benefic or aspected tra
benefic,sheturns a benefic,evenif in a waningstate.

ihe 2nd,4th,5th,8th,9th and l2th lords are its friends. The
rest yiz. 3rd,6th,7rh, l0th and llth lords from Moolatrikona
are its enemies. The exaltation sign's lord is always friendly
even if he ownsthe 3rd,6th,7th, lOth or the llth from Moola-
trikona. If, however,friendship and enmity occursimultaneo-
usly none prevailsbut equalityor neutrality.
Take for examplethe case of Mars. The Moolatrikona
for him is Aries. The I lth lord from there is Saturnand hence
he is inimical. But he is as well a friend, as he is the lord of
exaltationsignof Mars. Sincewc get enmityon onecountand
friendshipon the other, Saturn becomesequalto Mars. Take
aeainthe relationshipof Venus. He owns the 2nd and ?th from

respectively. Hence he is neutralto Mars.

7l-74. CALCULATION OF PR,ANAPADA.' Convert the
given time into vighatikasand divide the same by 15. The
resultant Rasi, degreesetc. be added to the Sun if he is in a
movable sign which will yield Paranapada. If the Sun is in a
fixed sign, add 240degreesadditionally and if in dual sign add
120degreesin furtheranceto get Pranapada. The birth will be
auspici-ous	if Pranapadafalls in the 2nd, 5th, 9th, 4th, 10th or
llth from the natal ascendant.In other houses, Pranapada
indicatesan inausPiciousbirth.
Notes : The calculation of PranapadaLagna is exemplified
below, as Per the aboveslokas:
Assumebirth is at l6gh 25vi. When this is convertedinto
vighatikas,we get 985. Divided by 15, this yields 65.66'Rasi
which means65 signsand 20 degrees. Expungingthe multiples
of 12, we have5s 200or 1700.
The next step is to add this straightawayto the Sun's
tongitudeif he is in a movable sign. Supposethe Sun is in
Aries 15 degrees,we get 170*15:185 or Libra 5 degreesas
Pranapadaascendant.
In the sameexampleif the Sun is in a fixed sign,sayTaurus
15 degrees,we have to add another 240 degrees,So to say,45
(the Sun)+240*170:455 or 95 degrees(Cancer5 degrees)as
Pranapadaasceadant.
Again, alternativelyif the Sun is in a dual sign,say Gemini
150,we haveto add only 120 degreesin placeof 240 degrees.
That is 75 (Sun'slongitude)*120*170:365:50 Ariesis Prana'

affirmative.
St4ge2 : It is not enoughif re state that the delivery will
be bcfore 273 days. We must narrow down the period still
briefly. The Sun's position at Adhana will tell ur the possible

Stgc 3 : .Aftcr the above step, our job is to dig out the

Serrvali (ch.8, Verses 4647), the natal Moon will be either in

Moon should be Leo or in Scorpio. The readerwill obscrvethe

Then where ghould"the Moon exactly be ? Is her birth position

with the hclp of Adhana (or prasna). And the correct ones
bringing the variouspossibilitiesto a coincidentalmanner should
be corectly judged without ruehing to conclusions sinply
theoretically.
Ihus the reader will be convincedof the fact that Adhana
time noted is correct as we got back to the birth details from
Adhana and vlceyersc ac-curatelywithout any ambiguity what-
80ever.
From the saidtwo processesbasedon accuratelymaintained
recordsfor purposes of scientific research,I, rather we, firmly
can concludethe followiog without a shadowof doubt :
l. Gulika's longitudewill corrcspond to the beginningof
Saturn'sMuhurta only, as suggestedby the sage, irrespectiw of
any other authority stating that it should be for the end of
Muhurta ruled by Saturn. In fact, I have not come acrossany
cage'swork stating contrarily to what Parasara stated in this
regard. Suppose we have calculated Gulika for the given
birth chatt for the end of Saturn's muhurta, the longitude of
Gulika would bave advancedby 24 degrees. That would put
the Adhana still 24 days behind the noted date. Pleasenote that
we have exactly reached the Adh4na date a$ per the record
maintained without any variation. This proves that Gulika
shouldbe at the beginningof Saturn'sMuhurta.
2. AccurateAyanamsais only that of Lahiri and that accur-
ate it is as to the seoond of arc. This contention is proved by
the fact that we have made use of the Moon's longitude. Other
4 loogitudesusedby us in the processof getting back to Adbana
are simply angular distanceswhich will not be affected by any
Ayansmsa. But the Moon's longitude will vary plus or minus
accordingto the Ayanarhsa,and Adhana time will be minus or
plus accordingto the variation. Whereaswith lahiri's position
of the Moon, we did not experienccany anamolyin the Adhana
computation. Similarly in progressing towards the birth date
from the Adbana date, Moon's longitude playeda significant
role. If for examplewith anotherAyanamsa,the Moon goesto
Piscesin the Adhana,her natal position, will yet be in Leo but
inconsistentwith Adhana position. Hence Lahiri Ayanamsa has
all the perfection required for calculationof eventhe Nadiamsas.

Divide the time of birth (in ghatis, vighatisetc.)from Sun-rise

6-8. GHATT LAGNA (GHATIKA LAGNA)..Now lisren to
the method of working out Ghatika Lagna. This Lagna ctranges
along with every Ghatika (24 minutes)from the Sunrise. Note
the birth time in Ghati and vighatis. Considerthe number ot'
ghatispastas number of Rasisor Ghatika Lagnas.The Vighatis
be divided by 2 to arrive at degreesand minutes of arc past
in the said Ghatika l-agna. The product so arrived in Rasis,
. degreesand minutes be added to the Sun,s longitude as at
Sunrise to get the exact location of Ghatika Iagna. So say

Notes : Let us find out the Ghatika lagna in the above
examplecase,
Birth time is 12 ghatiswhich gives 12 Rasis. Vighatisleft
are 30 which are to be divided by 2 and treated as degrees.
30 divided by 2 yields 15, i.e. 15". Thus, we note 12 signs

9. USE OF SPECIAL ASCENDANTS.' Keeping the
planetsat birtb as it is, preparevariousBhava charts with respect
to eachspecial ascendantand analyse as done for the natal
ascendant.
Notes : This is a very important clue given by the sage'
We get the 'longitudes of the three special ascendants,viz'
Bhava Lagna, Hora Iagna and Ghatika Lagna' Apart from the
natal ascendant,the planets will remain in different bhavas
according to ttre special ascendantbeing considered' Thus we
get foui different Bhava charts. If a planet remains in the
iame bhava in all the four bhava charts,it will speciallyreveal
the bhavaeffects due to it. Otherwise, its effects are proprt-
ionatelyalteredin respectofthat bhava.
The Benaresedition(Chaukambhaseries)hasthe following
special hints in this chapter respecting planets and bhavas,
t-hus: The planet on the cuspof a housewill give full effectsdue
to the bhava concerned. The one in Bhava Sandhi (end of
house)givesno resultsdue to tbat bhava. (This doesnot roean
that the planet is wholly ineffective. It is, suffice to say,
ineffectiveas far as that bhavais concerned')Ifa planetis ahead
of the Bhavasphuta(longitude)of thevariousLagnas(i.e.Natal,
Bhava, Hora and Ghatika Lagnas)but within I5", its effectsdue
to the Bhava concernedstart diminishing. Converselyif it is
prior to the cuspbut not beyondl5o, the effectsproportionately
increase. Needlessto mcntion that on the 'cusp', the effcctsare
more revealed. This gives us a clue that longitudearrived iilf

10-131.VARNADA DASA : I now derailVarnada Dasa
justby knowing which, one can dealwith the longevityof a
native. If the natal ascendantis an odd sign count dirctly from
Aries to natal ascendant. If the natal ascendantis an even sign,
count from Pisces to the natal ascendant, in the"ieverseorder.
Similarly, if the Hora Lagna is an odd one, count from Aries to
Hora Iagna in direct order. If the Hota Iagna is an even one,
count from Piscesto Hora Lagna in the reverseorder. If both
the products are odd signsor even signs, then add both thq-
figures. Ifoneis odd and the otheris even, then knowthd
differencebetweenthe two products. If the latest product, in
this process,is an odd one, count so many signsfrom Aries in
a direct manner;if an evenone, count so many signsfrom Pisces
in reverseorder. The sign so known will be the Varnada for
the ascendant.
t-a-tes ;Take the caseof a'native who hasLibra (an odd
sign)as natal ascendantand Scorpio (an even sign) as Hora*:,
Lagna. When we count from Aries to Libra (odd sign-hence
direct), we get ?. Again from Piscesto Scorpio (Hora lagna, an
evensign-hence reverse)we have 5 signs.We haveto add these
two figures,as'theyare of the same class,i.e. odd. We get 12. l
This productis an evenone. Hencewe have to count 12 signs
from Piscesin a reversemannerto get Varanadafor the I:gna.
Thus we get Aries. This is the Varnada Rasi for natal ascendant.
There is a suggestionfrom one quarter that longitudes
of natal ascendantand Hora Lagna be also taken into consid,
eration.In that case,the counting when done from Aries, is to
be done from zero degree. And from Pisces,it is from the last
degreeof Pisces,i.e. the 30th degree of Piscesis the starting
point. J

reverseis the order for evensigns insomuchas thesenamesare
concerned. Planetsin beneficShashtiamsasproduceauspicious
resultswhile the opposite is true in caseof planets in malefic
Shashtiamsas.
Notes : The method of calculating the ruling planet for
each Shashtiamsa(or 1/60th pat of asign or 30'of arc) is
advisedin sloka 33 above. Assume that Venusis placed in
Capricorn 13"25', To find out the Shashtiamsalord, ignorc the
sign positionand multiply the degreesand minutesby 2. Hence
13" 25' x2:26" 50'. The degreesi.e. 26 (ignoring minutes)be
divided by 12. The remainderis 2 which should be increase,:l
by l. Thus we get 3. Count 3 signs from Capricorn. The
resulting Shashtiamsapositionis Pisces whoselord is Jupiter.'These positionscan also be markedin a zodiac,aldiagram for

musicalachievements.If Jupiteror the 2nd lord be in 'Kubera'
Shashtiamsa,	one will be very affluent. If a planetin the 8th is
in 'Payodhi'shashtiamsa,fear from water may be expected. If
the lOth lord occupies

42-53. yARGA CLASSIFICATION .. Maitreya, explained
now are thc sum effccts of classificationsof different divisions
(or Varps so far narrated). Thesc are four kinds,viz. Shad
Varga(6 divisionsconsidered),SapthaYarga(7 divisionsconsid-
ered),Dasa Varga(10 divisionsconsidered)and Shodasayarga
(all the l6 divisionsconsidercd).In the Shadvargaclassification,
the Varga designations arc Kimsuka, Vyanjana, Chaamara,
Chatra and Kundala according to a planet being in 2 to 6
combinationsof good Vargas. Next is the Saptavargain which
these classificationscontinue in the same rnanner upto six
combinationsof good Vargas,the 7th additional Vargagetting
classifiedas Mukutir- In the DasaVarga scheme,the designations
commencefrom Parijata etc. suchas 2 gooti Vargas-parijatha.
3. Uttama,4. Gopura, 5. Simhasana,6. paaravata,7. Devaloka,
8. Brahmaloka, 9. Sakravahanaand 10. Vargas-Srirlhama.
In the Shodasa Varga schemethe combinationsof Vargas
go with designations thus : two good Vargas-Bhedaka,
3. Kusuma,4. Nagapushpa,5. Kanduka, 6. Kerala,7. Kalpa-
vriksha,E.ChandanaYana,9. Poornachandra,10.Uchchaisrava,
ll. Dhanvantari, 12. Suryakanta, 13. Vidrtrma, 14. Sakra-
simhasana,15. Goloka and 16. Vargas-Sri Vallabha. In these
divisions,the divisions falling in the planet's exaltationeign,
Moolatrikonasign,own sign, and the signs ownbd by the loid
of an anglefrom the Arudha ascendantare all to be consictered
(as good Vargas). The divisions of a combustplanet, defeated
pllryt, weak planet and a planet in bad Avasthaslike Sayanabe
all ignored to be auspicious,for thesedestroy the good yogur.
Notes : Four kinds of summaryof the Vargasor diyisions
are suggestedthus :

Chapter 6 Ro
(a) Shadvarga (considering six Vargas) vi;. Rasi, Hora,
Decanate,NavarnsaDvadasamsaand Trimsamsa.
(b) SnptaVarga(sovenVargas)addir;i: Saptamamsato the
Shad Varga.
(c) DasaVarga (ten Vargas) adding Shodasamsa,	Dasama-
msa and Shashtiamsadivisionsto the SaptaVarga.
(d) Shodasa Varga (all the 16 Vargasso far narratedby
the s.rge).
The groupsas aboveare as per slokas17.20of ch,7 infra.
The Vargasto be considered(asgood) are :
l. Exaltationdivisions.
' 2. Moolatrikona divisions.
3. Own divisions.
4. The divisionsof the ownersof the four anglescounted
from the Arudha Padaor PadaLagna.
The first threeare clear. The fourth one needsa clarifica-
tion. f n stoka 52 above,the word ,,€{l{alq" (Sx'anullnrh) has
beenuscclwhich meansfrom the Arudha hada,.irpada Lagna.
Hencethe lust quarterof sloka52 hints at the "tJrvisionsof the
lord.sot'anglesfrom the Arudha Pada"..(Similarly,.Swamsa"
or
Frivr means the Navamsaoccupied by Atma Karaka i.e. Kara-
kamsaascendant,vide ch. 33, infra.)
The sage suggeststhat the signs ownedby the lords of
Arudha f-agnaand of its anglesare consideredgood for Varga
Division. This will bring many signs--sometimes	as many as g-
in the purview of this rule. [t hasbeenfelt necessaryto bring
this liberalapproach contained in the sloka to the attentionof
the reader. In my opinion, the truer strengthof a planetlies
in its Moolalrikona, exaltationand own signpositions.
For the sakeof brevity, the good Vargasin number in the
context of Shadvarga through Shodasa Vafga are given special
designationsas detailedbelow :
If Shadvargaschemeis consideredtwo or more suchgood
Vargasare known thus :
2. Kimsuka 3. Vyanjana4. Chamara 5. Chatra 6. Kundala.
If SaptaVarga schemeis used the same namesupto six
good Vargasapply while seven good Vargasgo under the name
Mukuta.

If l)asa Vargaschemeis resorted to, the good Vargasin
numberare calledthus :
2, Parijata3. Uttama 4. Gopura 5. Simhasana6. paravata

respectivelyas Amara, Iravata and Vaiseshikamsas.In fact,
thesethreeare popularly known with these namesviz. Amara
etc.ratherthan with the onesgivenby Maharshi.
When ShodasaVarga scl.rcmeis wholly considered,the
numberof gooddivisionsarc knownas :

10. Llchchaisrava	ll. Dharrvantari12 Suryakanta13. Vidruma

. It may be notedthat mostof eventhe hoaryauthorshlve
not gonebeyondDasaVargascheme. The sagehasfully explai-
ned all the I6 Vargasinvolvedso rhat a planet'sactualdisposit-
ion is properlyknown,
As far as Hora or half of a sign is concerned"good
Vargas" shouldbe flexiblyusedas exceptthe Sunand Moon,
none hasrulershipof Hora. Jupiteris in exaltationVargaif in
Moon's Hora. Thcn, for Jupiterin Sun'sHora, and for other
four in any Hora, how rJowc classifythe Varga?ln my opinion,
we haveto follow the hint givenin sloka l3 of the nextchaptcr
that Jupiter, Sun and Mars give effectsif in Sun'sHora (as lar
as Hora is concerned)and the rest of the planetsexceptMercury
in Moon's llora. Mercury is good in both. the Horas. So to
say,theseare good Horas for the concernedptanets. Ii iollows
that Jupiter and Mercury are good in any Hora for Varga
classification. (Thereare further hints about Hora, vide ch.7,
sloka l3 onwards.)
Nextly, a bricf clarilicationis rcquireddbciut thi: Sun add

in Trimsamsasand the Moon canbe ih Taurus lii Venusian

' Now, coming back to the Varganames,qe will take up
some for clarifications. The word "Suryakantamsa"denotes

- It is also statedthat planetsin own signsget full strength.'
Here a distinctiollis to be noted.Male planets in malesignsand
femaleplanetsin femalesingsget full strength. Mars and others
each have two signs. Mars, a male planet, in own signif in
Aries is betterthan Mars in Scorpio,a female sign. Venusin
Taurus is betterplaced than in Libra. Such inference may be
wisely made. Thesedetailsare elaboratelydiscussedin the rele-

13.16.HORA, DECANATE AND TRIMSAMSA EFFE.
CfS .' Jupiter, the Sun and Mars give (pronounced) effectsin
the hora of the Sun. The Moon, Venusand Saturndo so when
in Moon's hora. Mercury is effectivein both the Horas. In
the caseof an evenRasi tle hora of the Moon will be powerful
in effectswhile the Sun'shora in an odd sign will be so. Full,
medium and nil will be the effectsrespectively in the beginning,
middle and the end of a hora. Similar applicationsbe madefor
a decanate,Turyamsa, Navamsaetc. As for Trimsamsaeffects
the Sun is akin to Mars and the Moou is akin to Venus. The
effectsapplicableto Rasi will apply to Trimsamsa.
Notes : The three male planetsin Sun's Hora will be reve-
aling while Venus, Moon and Saturnare good in Moon's Hora.

-- 93 of 482 --

Chapter 7 gs
Here again,Sun's Hora of odd signsand Moon's Hora in even
signsare given preference. Now from this, it emergesthat Sun,
Mars and Jupiterare highly powerfulin the first half of an odd
sign and Moon, Venus and saturn are very revealing in the
secondhalf of an evensign. Mercury is powerful in any Hora
whetheran odd sign or otherwise.
The effectsdue to a Hora will be derivedfully if the planet
is in the first one-tbirdpart of the Hora. The effects will be
mediumor nil accordingto the placementsbeingin the second
or third part of the Hora.

Notes : A planet away from the Sun is immune to tossof
rays, and can expr€ss itself fully. This need not be literally
misinterpreted that the one not beiog in the 7th from the Sun
will be ineffective. For example, we have Ubhayachari and
other yogasin which case,a planet other than the Moon is
relatedto the Sun by closepositions. This doesnot mean that
thescyogaswill not fructify. If a planet is eclipsedin the Sun,
it provesimpotcnt. Thie appliesto Venus and Saturnas well,
againstthe common belid that these two do not lose rays cven
if combust and hence are free from Astangata dosha. This
euggcstionis only for Ayurdaya calculations and rectifications
of planeraryrays (or Graha Kiranas). Pleaseseeths following

3-6. SHORT-LIFE COMBINATIONS (upto sloka 23) :
Should tho Moon be in the 6th,-8th, or the l2th from the
ascendantand be in aspectto a malefic, the child will die soon.
If in the ptocess there be g benefic'saspect,it may live upto 8.
If a beneflcis retrograde in the 6th, 8th or the l2th being in
aspect to a malefic, death will occur within a month of birth.
This is true only when the ascendantis unoccupiedby a benefic.
Should the 5th bc occupiedby Saturn,Mars and tbe Sunjointly,
(early) death of mother and brother will come to pass. Mars
placed in the ascendantor in the 8th and be conjunct Saturn or
Sun or be in aspectto a malefic,being bereft of benefic aspect
will prove a sourceof (immediate)death.
Notes : Here a pertinent query may emergeas to why the
sagementionscombinationsfor preMture death while longevity
cannot be decidedly declared upto the 24thyear ofage as per
his own statement. These yogas will guide us to dctect thc
immediatedefectsfor longevity and resort to remedial measureg
like firc sacrifice,prayers,donations, medicineetc. and save thc
from Akala Mrity.u or prematuredeatb,vide ch. 5 of Horasarr.
The Moon in an evil houseat'birth and in aspect to a
malefic will cause.early death. Even a benqfic'saspect on the
Moon, in the said Yoga, will causethe end at the age of E,
suggeststhe sage. If she is increasing,this neednot be feared.

One born in Scorpio ascendant with malefics in the

Yavanacharyas,as quoted by Kalyana Varma' The Moon
should be in the Qccidentalhalf if she is a beqrfic or be in thc
.oriental half if she is a malefic. If Mercury remainsunafricted,
by a malefic, this yoga will not come to pass.

In this connection, pleaserefer to ch.79 (Vol. II.of our

Notes : Our text requiresthe 2nd lord to be in exaltation
or in own sign so that the nativewill look after his people& C.
It has been practically seen that the 2nd lord's dignity is
essentialfor one to be helpful to others and be dutiful towards
his family members.Chaukhambaedition has almosta different
condition in this place : It statesthat the 2nd lord shouldbe in
deep exaltation or in own sign and be in aspectto Jupiter. The
net resultgiven therein is "fame and liked bypall". The condi-
tion of 'deep' exaltation seemsto me to be somewhatin excess
of the requirementwhile a simple own sign positionis givenas
an alternative. As such,I feel mereexaltationof the 2nd lord is
cnoughfor obtainingthe saidresults.

12. EYES .' If the 2nd lord is endowedwith strength,the
nativewill possessbeautifuleyes. Should the saidplanetbe in
the 6th,8th or l2th, therewill be diseaseor deformityof eyes.
Notes .' "Netresa" denotes the lord of the 2nd, i.e. signifi-
cator of eyes.This doesnot meanthat the l2th lord hasnothittg
to do with eyes. Preciscly,2nd lord and l2th lord respectively
lord over right eyeand left eyerespectively. This is from the
health point of view of eye. However,when the beautyof the
oyesis to be known, it is from the 2nd houseonly. Jupiter
well placed ih the 2nd, or the 2nd lord in exaltation,or
with a beneficwill give one beautifuleyes. While Venus in the
2nd or Full Moon in the 2nd will not depriveone of beautiful
eyes,defectsbf sight at an early stagewill result from the said
position. Mercury in the 2nd will havea say on the speech
ratherthan on the sight. HenceJupter's positionin the 2nd is
a safe bet for strong sight and beautyof the eyes,if the planet
is not with evils of fall and the like.

l. O Brahmin,I now tell you aboutthe 3rd house.Should
the 3rd housebe conjunct or aspectedby a benefic, the native
will be endowedwith.co-bornand be courageous.
Notes : 'Bhratru' in Sanskrit simply means a brother.
Proper adjectiveis to be added, riiz. Jyeshto for elder and
Kanishta for younger, to the word Bhratru. The 3rd house
spccificallydealswith the after-bornwhile the I I th housedeals
with preborn. This can be seep from sloka 32, Ch. 32 infra.
In the said chapter the sage instructsus to considerMars for
the 3rd bhavaand Jupiter for I lth bhava,
Youngersisteris denotedby the 3rd houseand Mars wbile

Notes : Mars alonein the 3rd, exceptin Capricorn or in

Notes: "The coborn will not live long" is the hint givenby
the phrase"Sadyonihantarau". Mars and the 3rd lord joining
in a malefic's sign or joining a malefic is said to be adversefor
the longevityof coborn. Similarly Jupiter and the I lth lord in
sucha stateis adversefor elderbrothersand elder sisters;Vcnus
and the 7th lord so placed for the spouse,Jupiterand the 5th
lord so placedfor progeny; Sun and the 9th lord so placedfor
father, the Moon and the 4th lord so placedfor mother,and so
on and so forth. So to sry the significatorand the lord of the
concernedhousetogetherin a malefic's sign or with a malefic
(or in an evil house)will bring harm to the said relative.

effectsbe declaredafter assessingthe strength and weaknessof

Notes : Saturnand Mercuryare termedas neutralplanets.
Rahu and Ketu are shadowyones. In the matter of deciding
the sexofcoborn or progeny, Saturnand Rahu be treated as
maleswhile Mercury and Ketu are females.
(Trailokyapraknsikavide sloka l2 treatsKetu as a female
and Rahuas aeunuch. Daivagnabharana	vide ch, I, s. 14-15
considersthe reverseof this at one place and imediately quotes
a differentsihool of thought. thus : Rahu is a malepi"nrt uod
Ketu a eunuch.)
All odd signsare malesigns and all evensignsare female
signs.Male signsexclusivelyoccupiedby male planetswill cause
birth of brothers. Converseis the casewith femalesignsoccu-
pied by female planets. This should be known from the 3;d
house being male or female sign & C. If the 3rd houseis
occupiedby a male planetas well as a female planet,there will
be brothers and sisters as well. The contributionwill come to
passif the contributor is strong.For example,Jupiterin the 3rd
in a male sign if strongwill causethe birth of a brother. If he is
weak,acquisitionof brother through Jupitrr will not be fruitful.
Then one hasto look upto alternativesourceswhetherthe native
will havea brother or not.

5-6. Should the 3rd lord and Mars be togetherin the gth,
destruction of coborn will result. Happinessin this respect
will come to pass if Mars or the 3rd lord is in an angleor in a
trine or in exaltation/friendlydivisions.
Notes : The suggestionsgiven in the notes for sloka 3
about spouse,elder brother, mother etc. may be suitably
extendedin this respectwith the help of the presentverse. For
example, if Venus and 7th lord are together in the gth, the
native'smarriedlife will be short (and in bad taste.)
Similarly, their conjunction in an angle or in a trine will
confer longlastingbeneficeffects.
Further hint that can be taken from the versein question
is : If a significator and houselord join togetherin a sign which
is identical with debilitation/inimical sign for one of them" the

Mercuryis in thc 3rd whilethc 3rd lord and Moon are together
as thc indicttor (Mars) joins Saturn, the cffects are : there
occurredthe birth of an elder sisterand therewill be youngcr
brothers.Further the third brother will die' ShouldMars and
Rahu be conjunctwhile the 3rd lord is in his signof debilitation'
there will be lossof youngcr brothers/sisterswhile 3 elder
brothers/sisters	wereattaincdby the native. Jf the 3rd lord is in
an anglewhile the significatoris exaltedin a trine and be in the
companyof Jupiter, l2 will be the numberof total coborn. Out
of these2 eldersand the 3rd, 7th, 9th and l2th of younger
coborn will be shortlived while six of the said twelvewill be
longlived.
Notes : The word 'Karaka' or significatorin sloka 7 etc.
shouldbe wiselynoted as Mars only and not as Jupiter,which
is borneby sloka I l.
In the contextof indication of one'o having 12 coborn,
this may be taken in the presentage to be a numberof coborn,
if not literally 12. Mars exalted and being in the companyof
Jupiter is denoted which means Jupiterwill be in fall. Someof
the coborn will die obviously becauseof Jupiter's debilitatioa

Notes : Sage Bhrigu also opines that the Sun in the 3rd
house will not allow the native to retain his elder brothers.
This position will affect one'srelationship with brothers and
sisters. Regarding Mars in the 3rd, Garga Maharshi states
that the nativewill obtain two brothersand two sistersall the 4
of whom will pass away early. The placementof Mars in the
3rd hasalsoadversesay on the native's character. For further

10-14.CONVEYANCES.' If the ascendantlord is a bene-
fic while the 4th lord is in fall or in the llth and the significator
(Venus)is in the l2th, thenative will obtain conveyances	in his
l2th year. Shouldthe Sunbe in the 4th house,asthe 4th lord
is exaltedand be with Venus,onewill acquireconveyanees	in his
32nd year. It will be in the 42nd yearthat one will be endowed
with conveyances	if the 4th lord joins the l0th lord in bis (4th
Iord's) exaltation Navamsa. Anexchange between the llth
and the 4th lords will conferconveyances	in the l2th year. A
beneficrelatedto the 4th house(andto its lord) will bring with
him auspiciouseffectswhile a maleficwill produceonly malefic
effects(in respectof conveyances).
Notes : It is not known why the 4th lord shouldbe in fall
for early obtainment of conveyances.This conditionseemsto
be the resultof defectivetext as the next line addsthat the 4th
lord may be in the llth. To me it occursthat the correct ver-
sion shouldreadas : If the ascendantlord is a beneficwhile the
llth is tenantedby Venus and the 4th lord, early obtainmentof
conveyance(around the l2th year)will come to pass. Another
rule given by the sage to get similar effectis an exchange
betweenthe lord of 4th and l lth.
Shoulda beneficbe in the 4th, aspectthe 4th, or is con-
junci with or aspectthc lord of the 4th houie, then the native
will be happywith conveyanccs	and be free liom accidentsand
dangers. A malefic replacingthe saidbenefic will causelosses
concerningvehiclesand reduceone to severeaccidents.

1-3. O Brahmin, now I tell you the effectsrelatedto the
5th house.If the lords of the ascendantand the 5th are in their
own signsor in an angleor in a trine, one will enjoythorough
happinessthrough his children. Should the 5th lord be in the
6th, Sttt or l2th, there will be no offspring, Shouldthe lord of
tbe 5th be combustor be with'malefics and be weak, there will
be no children; evenif per chance issuesare obtainedthey will
only quit the world soon.
. Notes : "Suta" in Sanskritusedin compoundword or ag

tten". Thereare howeverspecificoccasionswherethe expression
"son" is exclusivelydenoted by this tgrm. A logical approach
accordingto circumstances	is neededin interpretingsuchexpress-
tons.
The conjunctionof the 5th lord with thc ascendantlord in
a good house will ensureearly obtainment of children apart
from happinessthrough them. If they join in an evil house,
they will prove a defectin this respect.

Aspectof Mandi is suggestedby the sage. Though there is no

The rule as per the sloka applies to Aquarius, Taurus,
Virgo'andlibra. In the case of the latter two Lagnas, Saturn
though rules the 5th is hetpless obviously becauseof afriction

thc native will bcget daughters,so sayastrologers.
Notes : The 5th lord's joining rhe Moon will confer daugh-
ters (rather more daughters) than sons. The Moon is a planet
of multiplicity and hencethere will be a number of daughters.
An alternative suggestedby the sageis that the 5th lord
chould be in a decanateowned by the Moon. The Morn's decan-
ates are : the first tcn degreesof C-ancer,the secondten degrees
ofPiscesand the third ten degreesof Scorpio. If the 5th lord

Then thc nativc will obtain daughters.

wilt beget if Jupiter is in deep exaltation as Rahu is with the
2nd lord and the 9th is occupiedby its own lord. Therewill be
eight sonsif Jupiter is in the 5th/9th while the 5th lord is endo-
wed with strengthand the 2nd lord is in the l0th. Saturnin the
9th from fhe ascendantwhile the 5th lord is in the 5th itself,
will give 7 sons out of which twins will be born twice. If the
5th lord in the 5th ih conjunction with the 2nd lord, there
will be birth of 7 sons out of which 3 will passaway. Only one
son is denoted if therebe a maleficin the 5th from the ascen-
dant while Jupiter is in the sth from Saturnot viceversa, If
the 5th househasa malefic in it or if Saturnis in the 5th from
Jupiter, the native will begetoffspring only throughhis 2nd or

has Saturn in the 5th as the ascendant lord is in the 2nd, and
the 5th lord is with Mars, one will live long but losehis children

or the lord of such a house joining the 6th lord or being in the
6th/8th house indicates ulcers/bruisesto such a rclative tike
father. The Sun with such lordship and in such a housc
dcnotes such affectation of head,the Moon face,Mars neck,
Mercury navel, Jupiter nose, Venus eyes, Saturn. feet and the
aodesabdomen.
Notes : In these three slokas, we are instructedto know
of the possibleaffiictionsto the natlve'srelativesand to the native
bimself - both from the horoscopeof the native.

-- 151 of 482 --

Chapter 17 153
Firstly a certain significator or a certain bhavalord should
join the 6th lord or be in the 6th/8th house so that the relative
signifiedby the said Karaka incurs ulcers, bruises etc. For
erample,in a SagittariusLagnahoroscope,the 6th lord is Venus.
The 6th is Taurus and the 8th is Cancer. Suppose the 4th lord
Jupiter or the Matrukaraka Moon (signifying mother) joins
Venus or is in Taurus. (Cancer though the 8th house, the
Moon thereinshould not be deemedharmful in this regard and
Jupiterin Cancerwill not alsoaffict the motheras he is exalted
thereand protLctsthe 4th by aspect.) As a result, the mother
will incur ulcer, bruisesetc.
The relatives signifiedby planetsand Bhavasare denoted
in ch, 32, infra.
The second clue is to know the possibleaffiiction,to the
native,of a particularareain the body. If the Sun is the lord of'
the 6th houseor is with the 6th lord or is in the 6th/8th,the
native will be apt to incur affiiction of head, dnd so on and
forth. As regards, Rahu and Ketu, they do not own any house
in the normal context. Hence their position in the 6th/8th or
goiningthe 6th lord needonly be considered' Rahu or Ketu in
the 6th/8th will causestomachialdisorders'

6. FACIAL DISEASES.' Should the lord of the ascen-
drnt bc in a sign of Mars or of Mercury and be aspected
Merury, there will be diseasesof the face'
Notes : The lord of the ascendant should be in Aries,
Scorpio, Gemini or Virgo and be aspectedby Mercury. Even
lf Mars, ruling the ascendant,is in Gemini or in Virgo and is
aspectedby Mercury, the native will suffer facial diseases' The
occuPationcan be in anYbhava.
As regardsAries Lagnaand Scorpio Lagna a different look
be given to the placementof Mars in own sign. For Aries Lagna,
Mars in Scorpio or for Scorpio Lagna, Mars in Aries and
aspectedby Mercury will not produce the said adversity. unless
Man is seriouslyaffiicted otherwise.

Replacing the ascendantwith a ceriain bhava,theseaffiic-
tions to the concerned relativesbe predicted. For example,if
the 6th and 8th lords join the Moon in the 3rd bhava, danger
to cobornby drowning, lung disordersetc. be known. Should
Venus join the 6th and 8th lords in the I lth house; an elder
brother of the native will incur venerealdiseases.
Thus the qluesgiven by the sageshould be extensivelyand
cffectiv"ly applied in regard to diseasesfor the native and his
relatives.
. The affiictions to be causedby the planets,signsetc. have
been rather exhaustivelygivenin the notesin ch. 47 of my
English translation of Saraveli. Though it wasin the context of
death,the samemay be carefully used in knowing diseasesas
well. The readermay accordinglyconsult the said Notes.

7-gt. MISCELLANEOUS MATTERS .' The native will
befriend barren females(for sexual union) if the Sun is in the
7th. The Moon thereinwill causeassociationwith suchfemales
as correspondingto the sign becoming the 7th. Mars placed
in the 7th will denote associationwith marriageablegirls (or
thosewith menses)or with barrenfemales. Mercury indicates
harlots,mean females and femalesbelongingto traders'com-
munity. Wife of a Brahmin or a pregnantfemale will be in the
native'sassociationif Jupiter is in the 7th. Base females and
females having attained their courses are denotedby Saturn/
Rahu/Ketu in the 7th.
Notes : Any planet in the 7th (includingthe ?th lord, vide
ch. 24, sloka79) is normally indicative of absenceof sterling-
uessin characterin the mattet of sexualunion.
If the Sun is in the 7th in a horoscope promisinglose
character, the native will scek pleasures from femaleswho are
barren. As regards the Moon, the kind of females to sexually
intercoursewith, will correspondto the sign becoming the 7th
house. For example, when Virgo becomesthe 7th house the
female is a virgin; Libra prostitutes, Gemini a housewife and
so on and so forth. Mars in the 7th denoteg a female that
has come of marriageable age or one who is in her monthly
course or one devoid of conceivingability. Similarly, in other
cases. Jnpiter in theSh is alsono exception.
The aboveresults shouldbe declared,only after ensuring

malefic while the 7th house ,or the ?th Navamsabelongsto a

in the 7th while the lord of the ascendantis in the 8th, the native
will have 3 wives. There will be many wives if Venusis in a
dual sign while its lord is in exaltationas the Zth lord is endowed
with strength.
Notes : For a dual marriage,the 7th from the natal ascen-
dant or the 7th from Navamsa ascendantshould be owned by a
eunuch planet. So to say, Gemini, Virgo, Capricorn or Aquarius
should be the 7th as above. While this is fulfilled, the ?th lord
(from natal ascendant)should be in his sign of debilitation or in
a malefic'ssignalong with a malefic.
, The other two yogasare simpleand needno elaboration.

13-25.COMBINATIONS FOR FATHER'S DEATH : The
father of thp nativewould havepassedaway prior to the native's
birth if the Sun is in the 6thlSthllzth as the 8th lord is in the
9th, the l2th lord is in the ascendant,and the 6th lord is in the
5th house. Should the Sun be in the 8th while the 8th lord is in
the 9th, the native'sfather will pass away within a year of his
birth. If the lord of the l2th is in the 9th whilethc 9th lord is in
debilitationNavamsa,the native'sfather will facehis end during
the 3rd/l6th year of the native. Death of father will occur in
the 2ndor l2th yearif the ascendantlord is in the 8th as the 8th
lord is with the Sun. Should Rahu be in the 8th from the 9th
(i.e. 4th from the ascendant)as the Sun is in the 9th from the
9th (i.e. 5th from the ascendant),deathof father will take place
in the 16th/l8thyearof the native. If Saturnis in the 9th from
the Moon asthe Sun is with Rahu,the native'sfathbr will die in
the 7th or the 19th year of the native. The nativein his 44th
year will losehis father if the 9th lord is in the l2th as the l2th
lord is in the 9th. If the ascendantlord is in the 8th as the
Moon if in the Sun'sNavamas,the native in his 35th/4lst year
will losehis father. One will lose his father in the 50th year if
the Sutr,beingthe lord of the 9th, is conjunctMars and Saturn.
If the Sun is in the 7th from the 9th (i. e. 3rd from the ascen-

ascendant)as the Sun is inthe Zth from Saturn (i.e. gth from
the ascendant),the ages of 30, 2l or 26 will be fatal for the
father. If the 9th lord is in debilitationwhile his dispositoris

Note the lord of the 5th Mars occupyingthe 2nd housc in
Leo. The nativity has a number of splendidplanetaryinfluences
apart from tbis. As indicatedby sageParasara,the 2nd house
p-osition of the 5th lord gave her a world-wideposition and
honour for a very long numberofyears.
One can notice that the native will haveample opport-
unitiesof shiningbrilliantly, whetheror not on a world level,
with the 2nd hor:se placement bf ths 5th lord in strength and
dignity. Should there further be sufficient Raja Yogas etc. as
in the caseof the examplechart give4, the nativewill be sure to
hit the headlinesof the world press.
The position of the 5th lord in the 2nd will further cuase
asthmaand catarrh and the native will have infected lungs. Hc

Notes : Maharshi Parasaraenunciatesfour differcnt possi'
bi.litiesif the 5th lord is in the 6th house.
1. Obtainingsonsthat will be inimicalto the native : The
6th housedenotesone'senemies. The planet occupyingthe 6th

indicatesfather, 4th lord indicates mother and so on and so
forth. Suchrelativewill be inimicallo the nativecorresponding
to the rulershipof the occupantof the 6th house.
2. Loss of children : The 6th is the maraka sthanafor
children as it is the 2nd from the 5th. Hence loseqf progenyis
denoted.
3. Obtaining an adopted issue: Normally .this occurs
when one is unableto have progenyof his own loins, or fails to
have living children. Point 2 aboveanswersthp circumstances.
4. Purchaseof a child : This is also likc adoptidn. Hence
it follows that the situation of the 5th lord in the 6th house
is not very desirable, of course.excepting Saturn for Virgo
ascendant.
It is also not advisable for a female to have her 9th lord
in the l0th housefrom the point of view of filial happiness.

Dealing with the above horoscope, Parasaradescribes
lhe native's spouse thus : "she will be somewhat short-
tcmpered. Shewill deliver auspiciouswords. She will be dear
to her husband. Shewill live begettingfame from all the four
directions. She will be fortunate. She will be freefrom any
blemish(or Dosha). Shewill be dark in complexion. She will
feed the needy. In beauty, she will be akin to Rathi (the
extremelycharmingspouseof the extremely ch'armingCupid,
the Hindu God of beautyand son of Maha Vishnu). She will
possessmany ornamentsand be intelligent. Shewill be modest
and will not haveany desirefor other men (than her spouse,i.e.
the native in que3tion)." This is how sageParasaradescribes
the wife of the native in questionin verses27-29 ibid. Though
no direct reason has been attributed for the chastity of the
spouse,we cannotignorethe dispositionof the 7th lord, parti-
cularly with debilitatedMoon in the 7th. The ?th lord is in the
' 4th giving the native a spousewho would be extremelydevout
proving an asset to the husband. As such the view of our
presentsloka in regardto the spouseis at the outset defective.
Thus the wife cannot be out of the control of the native. The
Chaukambhaedition also clearlystatesthat the native'swife will
not be chaste, see qrql{aqlilfrilr and hencethe versionof our

One undesirable quality will, however, be found in the

Shewill go to other men and begetprogeny. The nativehimself
will be addicted to others' housewives.These are additional
efrectsof the 8th lord occupyingthe 9th housein a nativity. In
the caseof a Gemini native,Saturnoccupyingthe 9th house(his
Moolatrikona)will not produce these malefic effects. But his
benefictendencieswill be quite meagre.

This placementof the 8th lord will produce all kinds of

145-148.MISCELLANEOUS .' O Brahmin, thoseare the
efrectsofhouse lords which are to be deduced consideringtheir
strenghs and weaknesses.In the case of a planet owning two
bhavas, the results are to be deductedbasedon its two lordships
(for the sameplacement). If contrary risults are thus indicated,
the resultswill be nullified, while results of varied nature will
come to pass. The planet will yield full, half or a quarter of
the effects accordiry to its strength being full, medium and
negligiblerespectively. Thus I have told you about the effects
due to bhava lords in various bhavas.
,Notes : We get important and key clue to analysethe
efrectsof a bhava lord placed in a certain bhava. Except the
Sun and the Moon, the other 5 planetsown two bhavaseach. In

the caseof the Sun and the Moon, the results cited will come to
pass. (Herealso onc ahouldgive due considerationto various
other relative factors. Simply applying the effects without
checkingothet sourceswill leadto pitfalls.)
When a planet ownstwo signs,its placementin a certain
bhavais affectedby its two lordships. For example,takethe
caseof Saturnin the 5th house.fora Piscesnptive. His position
in tbe 5th as the I lth lord w:lt givechildren end happiness
through them. And as the l2th lord, he witl deny progenyso
that the native resorts to visiting shrines elc. in a bid to
obtain a progeny. [n such a contrary situation the drfferent
results mentionedfor Saturn'sposition in the sth shouldnot be
Btraightawaydeclared but alternativesourceslike Jupiter(the
significatorof progery) and the Moon (the owner of the 5th
house)shouldbe looked upto.
Next we are clearly instructed in regard to results of
mutually drfferentspheres. For exampleagain take the same
caseof PiscesascendanthavingSaturn in the 5th house. Othor
rcsults mentionedfor the l lth lord beingin the 5th houseere :
nativebeingreligiousand happy. As the l2th lord in the 5tb,
the resultmentionedis that the nativewill bo devoid of educa-
tion. After sortingout the controversyaboutprogeny,it should
be declaredthat Saturnin the 5th will deprivethe nativeborn
in Piscesascendantof learning(as due to l2th lor{sbip) and
witl make the native religiousand happy (as the I tth lobd).

2. EFFECTS OF DHT}A,IA IN YARIOUS BHAVAS
(uptosloka 13) : lf Dhuma is in the ascendant,the native will
be valiant,endowed with beautifuleyes.stupeliedin disposition,
unkind,wickedand highlyshort-tempcrcd.
Notes : Beforedbclaringresultsdue to placementsof non-
luminousplanets(i.e. Dhuma etc.), the student will do well
to refer to the sage'sinstructionin the concluding versesof the
presentchapter.
I havegiveniu my hotesfor slokas 66-69in ch.3 details
of ownership,exaltationand debilitation signs-for the l0 Upag-
rahas and Muhurta planets as culled out from Keeranuru
Nataraja'sJetakslankaram. These will benefit the reader to
considerlordships(or secondarylordships)of thesealso fer edch'
sign. 'For example, Gulika is 'lord' of Aquarius. Hence in
the caseof a Cancer native, he is the 'qth lord' apart fronr
Saturn'scandidacyfor 8th lordship. Of courseprimary impor-
tancebe given to Saturn and he should not be underratedin
that case.
The resultsdue to Dhuma, Gulika etc. will mature in
the Dasaperiodsof their dispositors. For example, if Gulika
is place.din Virgo, the effectsdue to Gulika will come to pa"s ln
the major and sub periods of Mercury
In giving effects Gulika is comparcd to,Saturn, Kata to
Rahu, Ardha Praharato Mercury and Yarnaghantakato Jupiter.
The first two a_remalefic in nature while the laJter twci are
benefics. Of all, Gulika js the most powerful in adverse
results while Yamaghantaka(son of Jupiter) is the gighty
benefic.

Notes : Throughout this chapter and others related to
calculationof strengthsof planetsand houses,the term ..Virupa'

-- 255 of 482 --

Chapter 26 2s7
has been used which denotes 'Shashtiamsas'or 'Kalas'. 60 such
units makeonq Rupa.
The planet that aspects is Drishti Graba or the aspector.
The planet that is aspected is known as Drisya Graha
or the aspected. The longitude of 'the aspected'.is to be
deducted from that of the aspector. If the longitudeof the
aspectedis lesserthan that of the aspector, increasethe longi-
tude of 'the aspected'by 360 to facilitate deduction,which will
yield the aspectualor Drishti angle.
After finding out the'Drishtiangles,the variousquantities
will have to be processedas under with the relevant principles :
Rule l. When aspectual angle is between 30 and 60
degrees,reduce30 degrees from the resultant aspectualangle
and tlivide by 2 to get aspectualvalue.
Rule 2. If the aspectudlangle is above60 but below 90
degrees,reduce60 from the aspectual angleand add 15 to get
aspectualvalue.
Rule 3. In case the aspectual angle is above90 but less
than 120 degreesthe aspectualanglebe redirced from I20, then
halvedand then increacedby 30, to get aspectualvalue.
Rule 4. If the aspectual angle is between 120and 150
degrees,reducetle angle of aspect ttom 150to get aspectual
value,
Rule 5. If the aspectualangle is between 150 and 180
degreesreduce I50 from aspectualangle and double the
resultantsum to get aspectualvalue.
Rule 6. When the aspectualangleis above 180but below
300 degreesdeductthe aspectualangle from 300and halvethe
resultantsum, to get aspectualvalue.
Needlessto mentionthereis no aspectualvalueif the angle
is between300 and 30 degrees.
. For housein aspect,considerthe cusp of the hpuse, akin
to a planetary degree.
In the caseof aspectsfrom Saturn, Mars and Jupiter,the
following additionsmay be notedas a simple formula.
A) Mars : When the aspectangleis 9G120degreesor 210-
. 249degrees,add 15 Virupasto the valueobtainedfrom
the speculum.

-- 256 of 482 --

258 grihat parasara Eora Sastra
B) Jupiter : When theaspect anglc is 120-t50degreesor	' .240-270 degrees incrcase the speculum valuc by 30	' Virupas.
C) Saturn : When the aspect angle is 6G90 degreesor
270-300degrebsand 45 Virupas to the value obtained
from the speculum.

In thc present.versesunder commentthe sageexplainsthe
mcthod to know the Uchchabalaof a planet. To find out this
strength, wc nced two tbiogs. Firstly the planet,s actual
longitude. secondlyits debilitationpoint which is constant for
all horoscopos' The deep debiritationpoints of the 7 planets
are noted on pp 38-39supra.
For example,assumethe Sun's placement in a given case
is Pisces12" l5' (or 342" r5'). His deep debiritatiori point is	'Libra l0' (or 190"). Hence :

Moolatrikona Rasi, it gets45 Virupas, in own Rasi 30 Virupas,
cxtreme.friend's Rasi 20 Virupas, friend's Rasi 15 Virupas,
neutral's Rasi l0 Virupas, enemy's Rasi 4 Virr:pas and in
extremeenemy'sRasi 2 Virupas. Slmilarly those values occur
for the other 6 divisional occupations,u'2. Hora, Decanate,
Saptamamsa.Navamm, Dvadasamsaand Trimsamsa. When all
th.c: are added togeth€r the planet'b SaptavargajaBala emerges.
Notes : Next step is to find out thc Saptavargajabala of a
planet. The tablesof varioue Vargasas well as the compound
relationshipsof the planets,are given in the previouspag.r. T.be
compound relationshipsof two given planets, vide p. i2 npra
(including Hora lordship etc.) be seen in thc Rasi chart only
and not in the concerned divisional chart. Then the strengths
in Virupas for oach of the Saptavargasbe found out and added,
which is then called saptavargajabala of the planet.

7-71. DTGBALA OR DTRECTTONAL STRENGTH :
Deduct the 4th house (i.e. Nadir) from the longitudesof
Sun and Mars; the ?th house (i.e. descendant)from that of
Jupiterand Mercury; tb€ 10thhouse(i.e. meridian)from that of
Venusand the Moon; and lastly the agcendantfrom that of
Saturn. If the sum is above 180 degreesdeduct the sum from
360. The sum arrived in either way be dividedby 3 which will
be thepigbala (or directionalstrength) of the planet.
, Notes : As seenearlier,Jupiter and MercuryhaveDigbata
ln the ascendant. Venusand the Moon have this bala in the
4th hquse(i e, Nadir), Saturn in tho descendantand the Sun and
Matq op the meridian. These strengthsare full on the cuspof
the respectivehouseand nil on the cusp of the oppositehouse.
Hence note down the longitude of.the concernedplanet and the
cuspal degree on which it is bereft of directional strength.
Deduct the latter from the former. If the product exceeds180'
deduct the same again from 360. The sum so arrived at be
{iviaed by 3, which will denote the Digbala of the planet in
Virupas. The directional strengthacquired by a planet when it
is oq its most, powerful point is I Rupa or 60 Virupas. For
exami,leSaturn exactly on the 7th cusp gets I Rupa, and exactly
on the ascending degree gets zero Virupa as directional
strength.

8.9, KAALA B.'LA OR TEMPORAL STRENGTH
(upto sloka 17) : Firstly NATHONNATHA BALA. Find out
the differencebetweenmidnight and apparent birth time which
is called Unnata. Deduct Unnata from 30 ghatis to obhin Nata
(rc). Double the Nata in ghatis which wilt indicate idcntical
Natha bala for the Moon, Mars and Saturn. Deduct the Natha
from 60 to know the Unnatha bala of the Sun, Jupiter and
Venus. Mercury, irrespective of day and night, gets full
NathonnathaBala (i.e. of I Rupa or 60 Virupas).
Notes : Kaala Bata (or temporal strength) comprises of
the following sub divisions:
l) NathonnathaBala (diurnal and nocturnal strengths).
2) PakshaBala (Paksha:fortnight).
3) Tribhaga Bala (strengthdue to day/nigbt bclqg'msdein

5) Ayana Bala (equinoctialstrenglh).
6) Yudhdha Bala (strengthdue to partaking in planetary
war).
Though Naisargikabala discussedin betweenin stota 14,
this is an independent sours€ .of strength without referenceto

same from 12. The product so obtained be convertedinto
desreesetc,. and divided by 3 which will indicate the Paksha
baia of each of the beneficplanets. The Pakshabala of benefic
shouldbe deducted from 60 which will go to eachmalefic as
Pakshabala.
Notes :
Paksha
Pakshabala is decidedon the follo'wing basis :
bala for tenefic : Moon minus Sun
Pakshabala for malefic :60 minus benefic'sPakshabala,
'Beneficsform one group and eachof them will get the
samefigure of Pakshabata. (Mercury is to be treated as a
malefic-if he is conjunct a malefic. The Moon in dark half is a

12. TRIBHAGA BALA .' One Rupa is obtained by
Mercury (if birth is) in the first one third part of day time,. by
thc Sun in the secondone third part of the day and by Saturn in
the last third part of the day. Similarly, the Moon, Venus and
Mars get full strength (of one Rupa) in the first, secondand
last one third parts of the night. Jupiter gets this strengthat
all times.

210 Brihat ParasaraHora Sastra
Notes : This strength goes to one planet only, as I rupa.
Jupiter, bowevef,gcts I Rupa irrespectiveof birth time.
Thc day duration or night duration according to birth
beingin day or night must be divided by 3. With the follgwing
table, Tribhaga bala can be kaown, according to thc birth
being :
in lst patt of day:1 Rupa to Mercury
in 2nd part of day:1 Rupa to the Sun
in 3rd part of day:1 Rupa to Saturn
. in lst part of night:l Rupa to the Moon
in 2nd part of nighl:1 Rupa to Venus
in 3rd part of night:l Rupa to Mars
. at any time:l Rupa to Jupiter
Thus two planetswill get I Rupa of Tribhaga bala. ThBt
is I Rupa to Jppiter and I Rupa to the respectiveplanet in
whosepart the birth occurs. The other 5 planetsdo uot get aDy
Tribhaga bala.

I3. VARSHA-MAASA-DINA.HORABALA .. I5,.30, 45
and 60 Virupas are in order given to Varsha lord, Maasalord
Dina lord and Hora lord. Naisargikabala (or natural,strength)
hasalreadybeenexplained.
Notes : Under this hqadiiry, four different planets get
certainVirupas. Thesestrengthsare :
Varsha(Abda) lord : 15 ViruPas
Masa (nronth) lord
Dina (day) lord
= 30Virupas'
: 45 Virupas
Hora (hour) lord : 60 Virupas
How to decidethe saidlordshipsis explainedas under.
Varsha lord : Astrological year is different from othet
mcasures. The day on which the astrologicalyear begins can
be found out from the Speculum of abbreviatedAharganas,
vide p.272.To know the Varsbalord we shouldfirst ascertainthe
number of dayspast from thc beginning of Creation. This is a
very tedious process and hence we are concernedwith the
abbreviated Ahargana (or the number of days past from

-- 269 of 482 --

Chapter 27 .' 271
Creation). According to late Rev. Ebenezer Burgess, who
translatedSurya Siddhantain Englisb, as on January l, 1g60,
the number of dlys past from the beginning of Creation are
714,404,108,573.
To know tho day on which the astrologicalyear in which
birth took placebeganadopt ihe following formula. Divide the
number of days past from the day of Crcation till the day of
birth by .60. Rejoot remainder and mulriply the qgotient by
3. Increascthe post-multiplied product by I and divide by 7.
The remainderwill indicatc the week day on which the astrolo-
gical year giving birth to the native opened. Remainder I
indicatesSunday,2 Monday and so on and so forth.
Assumethat birth took place on June l, 1984. Locate
from the Speculum of Abbreviated Aharganasfor January O
date 1984as 65142. Add 153 being the numberof d4ysupto
the day of birth (inclusivc thc birth date). Thus we get abbre-
viated days past from crcation to birth as 65295. This product
ihen divided by 3CI yields a quotient of l8l. Ramaindcr is to
te rejected. l8I multiplied by 3 indicates543. Increasedby l,
this gives544. When 544 is divided by 7, thc remainderis 5.
That is, the astrological year of birth for one born on June l,
1984 began on a Thursday. Hence this strengthor Varsha
bala goesto Jupiter, the ruler of Thursday
Mgsa Iord ; Divide the same Ahargana by 30 and the
quotient (devoid of remainder) iodi*t"r' months passedfrom
Creationto birth. The completed months be multiplied by 2
gnd increasedby l. The Iatestsum should be divided by Z and
the remainder indicates on which the birth month began.
Continuing with the same case, we divide 65295 by 30.
Quotientis 2176. This sum multiplied by 2 and increasedby
I .denot€s4353. Dividing 4353 by 7, we get a remainderof 6
denotingFriday. That is, the month of birth beganon Friday
and lhe Masa bala goesto Venus,the lord of Friday.
Dim lord : Though the week day of birth can be known
from ephemeris or perpetual calendars,we better adopt the
method prescribed which will confirm if the Ahargana followed
iscorrect or is otherwise. The number of tr,.ys as arrived above
indicating Ahargana be divided by 7 and the remainder will
indicate the week day of birtb. In the examplecase65295

-- 270 of 482 --

272 Brihat ParasaraHora S.astra
dividedby ? leavesa remainder of 6. That is June 1,1984is
Friday. Hencethe Aharganafollowed by us is correct. While
consideringDina bala, the birth should be treated from sunris€
to sunrise.
Hence in this case,the Dina bala goes to Venus,ruler of
ttto"t;oruBara
: Hora meansplanetaryhour. Eachday from
runriseto sunriseis divided into 24 equalparts of one hour or
2.5 ghatikas. TheseHoras are ruled by the 7 planetsfrom the
Sun to Saturn. The first Flora of the day is ruled by the lord
of the weekday. The 2nd one is ruled by the lord of the 6th
weekday countedfrom the first ruler. The 3rd Hora is ruled
by fte lord of tbe 6th week day countedfrom the 2nd Hora
lord. Similarly it proceedsin the same mannertill the first
Hora of the next day is taken over by the lord of that. day
himself. Whicheverplanet rules the birth Hora getsthe Hora
Bala. Horas are to be calculated for mean local time and ngt
standardtime of birth.

14. NAISARGIKA BALA (NATURAL STRENGTH) :
Divide one Rupa (or 60 Virupas)by 7 and multiply the resultant
product by I to 7 separatelywhich will indicate the Natural
Strengthdue to Saturn, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, the
Moon and the Sun, respectively.
Notes : As per the aboverule, the Naisargika Bala in
Rupas are indicated below so that the reader need not calculate
himsclf.
. Sun : l.(X[ Rupa
Moon: 0.857Rupa
Mars : 0.286Rupa
. Merc - 0.429 Rupa
JuP : 0'571 Rurra
Ven : 0.714Rupa
Sat : 0.143Rupa
This strengthis acquiredby a planet due to its luminosity.
The brightestgetsthe highest Naisargika Bala while the least
bright glts ttre leastNaisargikaBala. The Sun is the brightest
amongthe 7 planetswhile Saturnis the darkest. The brightness
ofthe planetscan be guessedfrom the abovefigures.
This is an independentstrengthand has nothingto do with
. Kala Bala, and is constantfor all nativities and for ever. Hence
no individualcalculationsneedbe done.
NaisargikaBala hasa significantuse in the Shadbala. If
two planetsare of equal Shadbala, then the one with higher
NaisargikaBala prevails over the other.

15-17AYANA BALA : 45, 33 and 12 are the Khandas
for calculatingAyana Bala. Add Ayanamsato the planet (for
which Ayana Bala is required)and find out the Bhuja (distance
from the nearestequinox). Add the figure correspondingto the
Rasi (of the Bhuja) to thc Bhuja. The degreesetc. of the Bhuja
(devoidof Rasi)be multipliedby the figure correspondingto the
higher of the left out Khandas and divided by 30. Add the
resultant product to the sum obtained earlier. Convert this
into Rasi etc. lf the Moon and Saturn are in Libra or ahead
add to this 3 Rasis,and if in Aries to Virgo reducefrom 3 Rasis.
Similarly it is reversefor the Sun, Mars, Venusand Jupiter,(i.e.
additionor deductionir converse). For Mercury 3 Rasis are
alwaysadditive. The resultantsum in Rasi,degreesand minutes
be dividedby 3 to get the Ayaua Bala in Rupas'
Notes : Ayana Bala can be found out on the following
simple formula.
AyanaBala: 2t 27-!\r!anti X OO
-(23"27' plus or minusKranti) x 1.2793
The following points haveto be rememberedin respectof
of Krantis. when the Moon or SaturnhavesouthernKranti or
when the Sun,Mars, Jupiteror VenushaveNorthernKranti, take
plus. In a contrary situationin respectof these6 planets,take
minus. As far as Mercury is concerned' it is always plus
whetherhe has southern Kranti or Northern Kranti. Krantis
(or declinations)can be ascertained from standard modern
ephemeris.
The Sun'sAyana Bala is againmultiplied by 2 whereasfor
o t h e r s t h e p r o d u c t a r r i v e d i n V i r u p a s i s c o n s i d e r e d a s i t i s .
The following speculumwill help the readerto easilywork
out the Ayana Bala,whenthe Kranti of a planetis known'

15-20.EFFECTSOF A BHAYA.' The strengthof a Bhava
and its lord have already been explained. The actual effects
will bc a combination of bhavastrengthand its lord's strength.
If there is a benefic in the bhavaadd the sarf,eto the auspicious
effectsand deduct from inauspiciouseffects, which will denote
the not auspiciousor'inauspiciouseffects. If a malefic is in the
bhava, reverse the process, i.e. add inauspicious effecte and
deduct auspiciouseffects. Similarly aspectsand etrengths. If a
planet is cxalted or with suc[ a dignity, add auspicious effects
and reduceinauspiciouseffects. For debilitatlon etc. it is con-
vers€. InAshtakaY4tg,add Bindus (auspiciouspoints) and
'deductKaranas (inauspiciouspoints). If a bhava extendsto two
Rasis,the rectification will be done as per both the lords. In
that casewhichever Rasi has more Bindus that Rasi will yield

r-3. METHOD oF PADA (w\ CATcULATIONS : O
Brahmin, I shall now tell you about the Padas (or Arudhas)
for bhavasand planets as well, as laid down by the earlier
great sages. The Pada ofthe ascendantwill correspondto the
sign arrived at by counting so many signs from the ascendant
lord as he is away from the ascendant. Similarly Padasfor other
nousesbe known through their lords. The word "Pada" exclu-
sively denotesthe Padafor ascendant(or Lagna Pada).
Notes : Maharshi Jaimini (author of Poon"a Mimamsa)
extensivelydealtwith this systemof astrologyasgiven in ch. 29-
33 hereof. Though sageParasarahas originally sown seeds,later
on Jaimini delved deepand located many pearlsout of his great
wisdom and intuition. Thus it has become to be known more
by the nameJaimini astrologyrather than Parasari.
To work out the Padasetc' enunciatedin these chapters,
we shall considera nativity as indicated below calling it th.e
standardnativitY.

to proceedas under. First ofall we understandthe 12 Arudhas
thus :

2. Dhana Pada
3. Vikrama(Bhratru)Pada
4. Matru (Sukha)Pada
5. Mantra or Putra Pada
6. Roga or Satru Pada
'1. Dara Pada(KalatraPada)
8. Marana Pada
9. Pitru Pada
10. Karma Pada
11. Labha Pada
12. Vyaya Pada
In calculating the Arudha pada for a house; note the
number of signsits lord movedaway from that particular sign.
Count so many signs from the lord in question. The sign so
arrived will be the Arudha for the sign under consideration.
In the standardnativity, Scorpio is the ascendantand its
lord Mars is 9 signsaway from the ascendantand is iri Canccr.

" 3. If the lord of a bhava is in the 4th from the bhava, no
countingis required. The houseoccupiedby the lord itself (i.e,

6-7. PADAS FOR PLANTES : Note the posirion
planetand seehow many signsaway is its own sign with
renceto its position. Count so many sign from the said own
sign and the resultant slgn will become the Arudha of the
planets. lf a planet owns two Rasisor if a Rasi is ownedby two
planets,considerthe strongerand declareeffectsaccordingly.
' Mtes : Here we are taught of what can be called as
Graharudhaor planet'sArudha. From a perusalof the above
verses, we can take it to mean that there are 9 planetary
Arudhas. Sincethe sageuses"Rasi ownedby two planets" he
obviouslyhints at co-rulershipof Rahu and Ketu. Rahu is a
co-rulerof Aquariuswhile Ketu shares ownership of Scorpio
(Vide sloka 157, ch. 46 infra).
Assumethat the Sun is in Capricorn. Counting from Capri-
gorn to Leo we get 8 signs. Again from Leo we count 8 signs
and reach Pisces which is the Arudba for the Sun. The excep-
tions statedfor Bhavarudhasdo not apply to Graharudhas.
In caseof other 5 planets(Mars to Saturn) each owns two
signs. Then the counting of planet's Arudha in such a caseis
with referenceto the strongerofthe two signs. For deciding
strengthsof signsand planetsone has to usehis wise judgement
apart from consultinghintsgiven in ch. 46. However,we do not
haveany authenticinformaticn availableas to how to useGraha-
rudhas. Either we haveto work on bxperienceor keepsilent on
this issue. The literature available on Jaimini system being
limited nothing more can be said about this.

explainedearlier is (of course)of prime importance.Upa pada is
calculatedfor the bhava following the natal ascendant. This
upa Padais also called Gaunapada.o excellentof the Brahmias,

-- 302 of 482 --

. , $
304 Brihat ParasaraHora Sasfta
if Upa Padais conjunctor aspectedby a beneficplanet,one wili
obtain full happinessfrom progeny and spouse. Should the
Upa padabe in a malefic's sign or iq aspectedby or.. is con-
junct a malefic, one will become an asceticand go with-
-outa wife. If (in the said circumstances)there be a "benefic
aspect (on upa pada or the related' malefic), or conjunction'
deprivalof sfouse will not cometo pass. In this case,the Sun if
.*ilt.d or ina friendly sign,is.not a malefic. He is a malerlcif
in debilitationor in an enemy'ssign.
Notes : RegardingUpa pada calculations,therc are more
thln two views on the same sloka of Parasaraor an idcntical
Sutra from Jaimini. In our text, the word "qgqq" (Anuchara)
is used which denotes"the house following the ascendantat
birth". some interpretthis as the 5th from ascendantwhile I
feel it shouldbe the housesucceedingthe natalascendant,which
is the l2th trousein normal sense.
Howevet,when we studyother commentarieson Jaimini'
(for examplechaukamba Hindi edition), we are taught that it is
iU. tZrtt housefrom natal ascendantin the caseof an' odd sign
ur".naing and it is the 2nd house from natal ascendantin the
caseof io "r.o sign ascending' This argument'meseerhs'is
moresound. Accordinglythe Padafor the l2th or the 2nd from
L"goo is called Upa pada. In calculating Upa pada' tle rules
mentionedin verses4 and 5 of the previous chapterbe kept in
mind.
Now take the standardnativity. The ascendantis Scorpio'
an evensign. Its 2nd houseis sagittariuswhoselord Jupiter is
8 signsaway from Sagittarius. Hence we count 8 signs from
Jup-iter(in Cancer). We so reach Aquarius which is the Upa
pada in this case.

7.12. EFFECT OF 2ND FROM UPA PADA .. If thc 2Nd
from Upa pada is a beneficsign or is aspectedby or conjunctwith
a benefic,the samegood results(as for wife and sons)will comc
to pass. If there be a planet in the 2nd from Upa pada in
debilitation sign/Amsaor be conjunct with a debilitatedlmalefic
planet, there will be destructionof wife. If the said occtrpant
be in exaltationsign/Navamsaor be aspectedby another planct,
therewill be many charmingand virtuouswives. O Brahmin, if
Gemini happensto be the 2nd from Upa pada, then also thcre
will be many wives. O excellint of the Brahmins, if the Upa-
rudha or the 2nd therefrom be occupiedby its own lord or
if the saidlord is in his other own house,the deathof wife will
be at an advancedage.
Notes : In the examplecase,the Upa pada is in Aquarius,
a malefic'ssign and is powprfully aspectedby malefic Mars and
is without benefic'saspect. However, thc 2nd from Upa pada is
well fortified as its lord Jupiter is exalted and aspects the said
2nd house. Hence the native is happily married and endowed
with progenichappiness.
Loss of wife is to be expcctedif thc 2nd from Upa pada is
occupiedby a debilitated planet, or the occupantof the aaid 2nd
is in debilitation Navamsa,or is conjunct a debilitatedplanet (i.e.
a baneficdebilitatedjoining a maleficin the 2ird from Upa pada)
or a beneficjoining a maleficin said 2nd house.
Taurus becomingthe Upa pada is said to givc many wives
or plurality of marriage.
Although there may be combinations for early loss of
spouseif the 2nd lord from Uparudha(or Upapada)is in the 2nd
itself or is in his other sign, it.will considerablyprot€otthe native
from sucha calamity. And the spouseas a resultwill live udto
an advancedage.

the obetructingone, the former will prevail. .Or if the number
of Argalasare more than the obstructingplanets,then also the
Argala will prevail. If therc are 3 or more maleficsin the 3rd,
they will cause vipareeta Argala(more effectiveintervention)
which will alsobe harmlessand be very favourabre. The 5th is

casemay be. The Argata unobstructedwilr be fruitiul while the
one duly obstructedwill go astray. The Argala effectswill be
derivedin the Dasaperiodsof the Rasi or planct concerned.

an impediment or obstruction. Arga:a is calculatcdfrom a

The Argala of 4th houseMar$js counteredby lOth houseSaturn,
that of Sun-Mercuryin the 2nd by Venusin the l2th and that of
Jupiterjn the I lth by Moon-Rahuin the 3rd.
As far as the nodesare concerDedthese are calculated in a
a reversemanner. From Rahu, the 2nd horrsecounted in
reverse order contains Sun-Mercury causing Argala to Rahu
which is, however,obstructcdby Mars in the l2th from Rahu
(counted in reverse manner), similarly in all cases these be
properly understood.
By way of additional information, seeGocharavcdha and
beneficplacesfor examplefor the Sun which will prove that our
interpretation of Argala obstructedis correct :

In the above figures, thc upper ones denotethe Sun's
favourabletransitsfrom the Moon and the lower ones denote

the Sun in the 3rd housefrom the Mbon during transit will be
favourable. But his favourabledispositionwilt remain curbed
if simultaneouslythe 9th from the Moon is transitedby another
planet(than of courseSaturn,which is an exception).Again just

as there is Vipareetargala(or Argala itself eliminated), there is
also Vipareeta Vedha. Vipareeta Vedha will proveauspicious

anotherin the 9th from the Moon. The momentanotherplanct
joins the Sun in the 3rd from the Moon, the Vedhain the 9th
from the Moon is off and the Sun in the 3rd proves auipicious

anotherplaccdin the 4th quartcr of the respectiveobstructive
Rasi. Simllarly2nd quarter'sArgala is eliminatedby the 3rd

Notes : We havc learnt that an Argala, for examplein the
4th from a bhavaor a planet is eliminatedby anothelplacedin
the lOth housefrom the original planet/house.Here,the rulesfor
obstruction of Argala are still narrowed down. Accordin$ly,
there are only two circumstancesof Argala getting nullified.
Make the sign in which the Argala occursinto four quarters.(of
?" 30' each). Similarlythe signwhereobstructionoccursis also
madein four quarters. If the Argalacausingplanetis in the first
guarter (or first 7" 30' of the sign)while the obstructingplanetis
in the 4th quarter(i.e.22" 30'-30"), the obstructionindeedwill
come to pass. Otherwisenot. So to say Argala will operate
snd the obstructionwill fail. Likewisewhile the Argala planet
is in tbe 2nd quarterof the sign(i.e. 7' 30'-15'), the obstruction
(planetia 15"-22" 30' i.e. 3rd quarter)will combatthe Argala'

ihe Arudha Pada,for the natalascendant,and for the 7th from
both, the nativewill be famousand fortunate. A malefic or a
beneficcausingunobstructedArgalaaspectingthe ascendantwill
makeone famous. Similarly aspecton the 2nd house denotes
acquisitionof wealth and grains,3rd house-happinessfrom co-
born; the 4th house-residences,quadrupedsand relatives; the
5th house-sons,grand sonsand intelligeice,the 6th house-fear
from enemies; the 7th house-abundant wealth and marital
happiness,the 8th house-difficulties, the 9th house-fortunes;
the l0th house-royal honour;the llth house-gains,and the
12th house-expenses. The Argala by beneficswillgive various
kinds of happiness,while benefic effectswill be meddlingwith
maleficArgalas. Argala by both beneficsand maleficswill yield
mixed results.
Notes : For our own benefitwe should understandthe
word 'Argala' in a suitablemannerapart from the manner the
Argala functionsvis-a-visArgala elimination.
l. Argala can be causedby a beneficwhich is known as
Subhargala. This Argala can be from a malefic also, so that
the'beneficcausingArgala stallsthe maleficrole going against
the native. If the benefic'sArgala is obstructedby another,
ihen the beneficwill becomeineffectivein Argala and the first-
nentioned malefic will operatefreely.
2. Atgala can be by a malefic with referenceto a benefic
so that the native doesnot enjoy good effectsdue to the benefc.

In cbart l, Saturnand the the Sun are in mutual angles
from the ascendantand in their own signs. Hencethey will act
as co-workerscasringawaymutualenmity. And Saturnalthough
a dire maleficfor Scorpio ascendantwill become a Yogakaraka
by virtue of mutual angularity with the Sun having fulfilled
dignity reQuirements.
In chart 2, Mars and the Sunare in mutual angles from
the ascendantbut do not possesany dignity like exaltation' or
own housebut are debilitated. Hencethey will not act as Yoga
giving planets.
In chart 3, both Jupiter and Saturnare not angtlar from
the ascendantbut are investedrvith exaltationpositions. Hence
both the planetswill mutually representand becomefavourable
in their Dasaperiods. Also, seethe chart of Sri Morarji Desai
under sloka 110,ch. 24 in which Jupiter, Saturnand Mars play
as mutualco-workers.
It is specificallystatedthat the lOth housepositionfor one
of the planetsin the circumstanc$becomesexceedinglyfavour-
able. In the examplechart 1, the Sunis in the l0th withParas-
para Yogakarakaqualification in oppositionto Saturn'Hencethe
Sun will exceedinglyrevealbeneficialresults.Devoid of Saturnor
any other co-worker,the Sun in the lOth will not be that power-
ful. In other words, by virtue of co'workership,the Sun's role
gets immeasurablYfortified.

50.56. EFFECTS OF THE gTH FROM KARAKAMSA :
If the 9th from Karakasmsais aspectedor occupiedby a benefic,
the nativewill be truthful, devotedto eldersand attached to his
own religion. If a maleficis so relatedas above, one will be
attachedto his religion in boyhoodbut will take to falsehoodin
old age. If Saturnand Rahu are so relatedas above, one will
betray his eldersand be averseto ancient learning. If Jupiter
and the Sun are so relatedas above,one will betray his elders
and will be disobedientto them. Should Mars and Venusbe so
relatedas above,and joining in six identicalvargas,a femaleill-
relatedto the native will die. Mercury and the Moon so related
will causeimprisonmentof the nativedue to associationwith a
femalenot of his own. If Jupiteris alone related to the 9th
from Karakamsaby aspector by conjunction, the nativewill be
addictedto femalesand be devotedto sensualenjoyments.

2.7. NATURE DUE TO LORDSHIPS OF PLANETS :
Beneficsowningangleswill not give beneficefrectswhile malefics
owning angleswill not remain inauspicious, The lord of a trine
will giveauspiciousresults.The lord of the ascendantis specially
auspiciousas the ascendantis an angleas well as trine. The 5th,
and 9th housesare specially for wealth while the 7th and toth
are speciallyfor happiness.Any planetowning the 3rd, 6th, or
the llth willgive evil effects.The effectsdue to the lords of the
l2th, and 8th will dependon their association.In eachgroup,
the significancewill be in' the ascendingorder. The 8th lord is
not auspiciousas he owns the l2th from the 9th. If the lord of
the 8th simultaneously	ownsthe 3rd,7th or llth, he will prove
specificallyharmful while his simultaneousownershipof a trine
will bestowauspiciouseffects.The planet owning a predominant
housewill stall the effects due to another owning a lesssigni-
ficant houseand will give his own results.The 8th lordship of
the Sun and the Moon is not evil.
Notes : The rules given in this part will help us to decide
the gcod and bad planetsfor eachascendantbasedon lordships.
A summary of these rules is given below to enable use of
suitableapplicationof lordships.
l. KcnrlradhipatyaDosha: This blemishgoesto naturalbene-
fics by virtue of angularlordship. For example,for Gemini ascen

dant the ownershipof4th and 7th goesto Jupiterand hence he
is not a beneficfor this ascendant.Lagna lord owning an angle
i.e.4thl7thll0th,shallnot proveinauspicious.	(Even if he owns
an evil house,he is not classifiedas a malefic.) Natural benefics
are increasingMoon, Mercury,Jupiterand Venus.T'heirangular
lordsbip blemish will be in the ascendingorder. That is the
Moon is the leastmaleficaod Venus is the mostmaleficby such
ownership.
2. Maleffc as ownerof angle: If a maleficownsan angle
he will not be inauspicious. This doesnot meanthat tre wrtt
becomeauspicious.(ThesaBehas cautiously worded his verse.)
To be auspiciousby virtueof angularrordship,the maleficshouri
simultaneously	own a trine. If he doesnot own a trine, he will
be neutral by mere angular lordship;ncither he will be disad-
vantageous.For Libra ascendant.Satrunis classifiedas unsullied
yogakarakabecausehe owns the 4th (an angle)and the 5th (a
trine).The Sun's benelicencero Taurus asccndantcannot be
comparedto Saturn's for Libra, becausethe Sun hasonly one
housewhich is angularto the ascendant.For Leo ascendar,t
-Mars
becomesa top rank beneficas he owns an angle(4th) and a trine
(9th). similarly for cancer ascendant.The sameMars for capri-
corn asccndantby virtue-ofangularlordshipis not that,up.iio,
becausehe doesnot simultaneouslyown a trine. Sirnilarlyhis rote
for Aquariusascendant.weak Moon by virtue of angularlord-
ship remainsjust neutral.
3. Primarilywearth-givers	are the rordsof 5th and 9th. The
lords of 7th and lfth contribute to one's happinerr.pact oi
them should be individuarlywertdisposed.Trinar lordship to
Jupiterwill enablehim give wearthabundantryand uninteirup-
tedly. . venus becoming rord of 7th or l0rh wil give generar
happinessifthe occupiesan angleor a trine.
4. Lords of 3rd, 6th and llth are classifiedas evil planets
while the lords of 2nd, l2th and 8th wifi act accordingto asso-
ciation. If these lords simultaneousryown such another
house,they will be significantlyharmful. If sucha planet simult-
aneouslyownsa trine he will befavourable.For example,Jupiter
is doubly evil for Libra ascendantas he ownsthe 3id and 6th.
saturn,though owning the 8th, will be favourabrefor a Gemini
nativityas he is the lord of the 9th as wcll. In consideringtwo

-- 341 of 482 --

Chapter 34 34?
lordships in any context, the Moolatrikona house has prime
importanceas againstthe other ordinary house. The Moolatri-
kona lordship will reveal itself effectively rather than the other
own house.
5. When twc planets are involved in a context,.the one
with good lordshipwill stall the evil effects of anothcr planet
owning a lesspowerful house.To wit, if the 9th lord and the 8th
lord are both involvedin a yoga, the 9th lord will give his good
effectsobstructingthe evils due to the 8th lord.
6. We havethe following two setsof good houses,(a) lst,
4th, 7th and the l0th. (b) 5th and 9th. In eachgroupthe benefic
dispositionwill ascendfrom house to house. That is, Zth lord
is more powerfulthan the 4th. The 9th lord is so as against the
5th lord
7. Similarly two setsof evil housesare before us; (a) 3rd,
6rh and llth. (b) l2th, 2nd and 8th. Here againthe .maleficence
wilt move inthe ascendingorder. To wit, the llth lord is the
mostevil in his group whilethc 8th lord is so in his group.
8. The summary of points 6 and 7 is : the l0th and 9th
lords are the highestbeneficplanetswhile the I lth and 8th loras
are the mostadlerse.Thus,the lOth lord'scounterpartis the I lth
lord and the 9rh lord's counterpartis the 8th lord. (lf we consi-
der Saturnfor Aries ascendant,he getsone best house and one
worst house,i.e. the lOth and llth houses.The I tth housebeing
bis Moolatrikona,hc is predominantlythe I lth lord ratherthan
the l0th lord and hencevery evil. Similarly his role for Cemini
ascendantin which casethe 9th lordship prevailsover his 8th
lordship aud so he is not cvil but favourable.)
9. The rolesof variousplanetsare generallybasedon these
groundsand what we have had so far is a rough frame-work.
However,no decisionshouldbe takenat one single point. For
actual picture,the sageclassifiesthe planetsfurther in the succe-
eding verses.
10. As far as Rahu and Ketu are conccrned,they act
accordingto their position,associationand dispositors,ride verse
16 infra.

$-rc. NATURAL BENEFICS AND MALEFrcS.. Jupiter and
Venusare beneficswhile the Moon is mediocre in beneficence.
Mercury is neutral (i.e. a beneficwhenassociatedwith a benefic
and a maleficwhen relatedto a malefic).Malefics are the Sun,
Saturnand Mars. Full Moon, Mercury, Jupiterand Venusare
strongerin the ascendingorder Weak Moon, the Sun, Saturn
and Mars are stronger(in malefic disposition) in the ascending
order. In revealing maleficencedue to angular rulership, thJ
Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venusare significantin the asc"n-
ding order.
Notes: Jupiter and Venusare first ratc beneficswhile the
Moon is next to them. The Moon's variable dispositionshave
beengivenin the earlierpages.Mercury is neutral, i.e. a benefic
in relationto a beneficand is a maleficin relation to a malefic.
He has no dispositionof his own. If he is atone,he will be
favourable.consideringthe Moon and Mercury in beneficclasses,
the four planetsviz. Moon, Mercury, Jupiter and Venusare
superiorin the ascendingorder.That is Mercury is more bene-
ficial rhan Moon, Jupiter is more beneficialthan Mercury and
venus is the highestbenefic.However,some exponentshold the
view that Jupiter is the highestbenefic,see,.Subhanampotih',
As regardsmalefics,the Sun,Saturnand Mars comeunder
this classwhen the nodes are excludedfor they do not bave
their own disposition.Here again,the sun is the reast maleffc,
saturn is rnoremalefic than the sun; and Mars is the highcsi
maleficas againstthe Sun and Saturn.

the effectsasdue to their conjunction with a house lord or as
duc to the housethey occupy.
Notes : As alreadystated,Rahu owns Aquariusand Ketu
Scorpio. Still they do not havea dispositionof their own in
the matter of giving particularefferts. (ln poiut of fact, these
ownershipsare for calculationof someof 'Jaimni' dasasetc.and
not in a commoncontext.) Inasmuchas they do not have a
sign of their own, they havealsonot beenspecificallyclassified
as maleficor beneficfor the variousascendantsas could be seen
from the rules enunciatedby sage Parasarain the current
chapter. Henccit is suggestedthat the results to be given by
Rahu and Ketu will dcpendon theirassociationwith otherlords
and occupationof houses. So to say,if thcy are relatedto good
lords they will revealeffectsfavourableto the native, otherwise

19-22.PLANETS & ARIES ASCENDANT : O Brahmin,
listento thesewith examples. Even though Mars is the lord of
the 8th, be will be helplul to (other)auspiciousplanets. Saturn,
Mercury and Venus are malefics. Auspiciousare Jupiter and
the Sun. The mereconjunctionof Saturnand Jupiter will not
produceauspiciouseffects(althoughthey own a trine and angle).
If Jupiter is at the disposalof a malefic, he will surely give
inauspiciousresults. Venusis a direct (or independent)killer.
saturn etc. will also inflict deathif associatedwith an adVerse
planet(i.e. Venus). That is how the effectswiil be derived by
an Aries native.
Notes: For Aries ascendantMars is the ruler of the lst and
the 8th. The ascendantis his Mooratrikona sign while the gth

we have only two. These are Jupiter and the Sun. Even if
Jupiter is capturedby anotheradversary,his gocidresultswill be

harm. Venuswill provea killer as he is the 2nd and 7th lord.
Saturn and Mercury will also inflict deathif relatedto Venus.
The Moon's role is not discussedby the sage. The Moon will
give mixed results according to associationetc. as she is an
angularruler.
An associationbetween Jupiter-Sun, Jupiter-Mars or
Mars-Sunwilt be highly favourablefor the ascendantin question.

they own the 9th and t0th. It is because,Saturnis llth lo;d

23-24.FOR TAURAS ASCENDANT : Jupiter, Venus
and the Moon are malefics. Saturnand the Sun are auspicious.
Saturn will causeRajayoga. Mercury is somewhatauspicious,
Jupiter etc.and Mars will inflict death. Thesehints are for a
Taurusnative.
Notes : Jupiter is a maleficfor Taurusascendautand will
avail of the first opportunity to inflict harm as he ownsthe gth
and llth housesboth of which are evil. He is the first-rate
adversary. The Moon being the 3rd lord is not auspicious.
Venus is also classifiedhere as an evil planetand a maraka
planet, The words ,,frqtEq]" (Jeevadayo)indicate the Jupiter
group, i.e. Jupiter, the Moon and Venus. Accordingto the
following words of Susloka Sataka-qq1 sE.T*s) ;f qqqlfq il
*vrrrq-for Scorpio ascendantthere is no blemish (to ivlars)of
the 6th lordship and also for Taurus ascendant(in the caseof
Venus). Sale Parasara apparently took into serious consi-
deration the 6th lordship (Moolatrikona) of Venusand calssified
him as an adversary. Though there are somemore exponents
to favour Susloka Sataka's line of thinking, Parasarabeingan

undisputed authority should be given more weight. The Sun
and Saturnare beriefics. Saturn owns thc bcst trine and best
angleand hencehc will bestorvkingly statuson the native. The
. Sun though a maiefic by virtue of owning an angleproves
auspicious. The rule that a malefic owning an angleshould
own a trine also,so that he becomesa Yogakaraka(vide sloka
14 supra) is naturally not applicablc to the luminaries as
they own only one sign each. As regardsthe role of Mercury,
. he is only of mixed nature for Taurus ascendantand he is not
an excellent benefic by virtue of orvning a Maraka house in
addition to a trine. The 5th is his Mqolatrikonaand exaltation
sign, If Mercuryjoins Saturn/Sun,he will act more effectively.
Mars is classifiedas a killer apart from Jupiter,Venusand
the L{oon. Mars is a killer for he owns the 7th and l2th. The
role of Jupiter and Venus as killers is also understandable.
Though the Moon is said to be a killer, she cannot inde-
. pendentlydo so for sheis only the 3rd lord which is the least
maleficamong 3rd, 6th and I lth. The luminariesare considered
not inauspiciouseven by ownership of the 8th house;as such
the 3rd house lordshsp of the Moon in the caseof Taurus be
lenientlyviewedfrom the point of wiew of inflictingdeath. Her
connectionswith Jupiter, or Mars can empower her to inflict
deathon the Taurusnative.

25-26. FOR GEMINI ASCENDANI : Mars, Jupiter and
the Sun are malefics while Venusis the only auspiciousplanet.
The conjunction of Jupiter and saturn is similar to that for
Aries ascendant. The Moon is the prime killer, but it is
dependanton her association. Thus have beenexplainedby
the scholarsthe effectsfor Gemini ascendant.
Notes : The three planets,viz. Jupiter, the Sun and Mars
are adversefor Gemini ascendant. There is no hint on saturn's
role exceptthat Saturn-Jupiterconjunctiondoesnot yield a yoga

8th and the 9th while the 9th is his Moolatrikona. Jupiterowns
thc 7th and l0th. It is my personalfeeling that an exchange
between Saturn and Jupiter in the 9th and l0th or their place-
ment in conjunction in the 9th/lOth, or Saturn in the 9th as
Jupiter is in the l0 will provea very favourablepoint. (This
line of thinking cannot be extendedto Aries ascenclant,i.e.
exchangebetween 9th and l0th lords & C for Jupiterwill be
in fall in the l0th in a key house.)
For Gemini ascendant,Mars ownstwo evil houses,the 6th
end llth and hencg he is a malefic. The Sun owningthe 3rd
will not be helpful.
Venus, the lord of the 5th and l2th, is declaredto be
higt ly favourable, as the 5th is his Moolatrikona. In view of
the friendship between Venus and Mercury, the l2th lordship
of Venus is not seriously consideredadverse. On the same
lines,Mercury for Libra ascendant is consideredfavourable
although he owns the l2th, which is his Moolatrikonaand
exaltation-thus a predominant house.

27-28. CANCER ASCENDANT : Venus and Mercury
are malefics,Mars, Jupiter and the Moon are auspicious.Mars
is capableof conferringa full-fledgedyoga and giving auspicious
effects. Saturnand the Sun are killers and give effectsaccording
to association.. Theseare Cancerascendant'seffects.
Notes : The role of the Sun is comparedto that of Saturn
as a killer. The Sun is the lord of tbe 2nd and Saturnrulesthe
7th and 8th for Cancer ascendant. Both the housesof Saturn
are inauspiciousand hencehe is classifiedas a killer. However,
they are not independently capable of doing bad or good but
act as per their relationshipwith others.
Venus is inauspicious by virtue of angular lordship
(4th house-Moolatrikona) and the llth lordship. (The llth
lord for a movablesign is a malefic, i.e. Saturn for Aries,
Venus for Cancer, the Sun for Libra and Mars for Capricorn

Chapter 34
ascendants.)Thus Venus gets a dual role to do evil lor a
Cancer native. The 3rd and l2th lordship of Mercury will
inflict harm and hencehe is inauspicious.
The best planet for this ascendantis Mars as he owns a
trine as well as an angle. The l0th lordshipwill prevail much
more favourably as the l0th is the best of the 4 anglesand
Aries is the Moolatrikona sign of Mars. The other two
favourable planets are Jupiter and the Moon. Jupiter is the
lord of the 6th and 9th. Though 6th is his Moolatrikona,the
sagehasgiven preferenceto the 9th lordship for obviouslytwo
reasons: firstly the 9th is bestof the two trinesand Jupiteris
a close friend of the Moon, the ascendantlord. The 3rd
favourableplanet is the Moon who is the ascendantlord. The
order of preferenceis Mars, Jupiterand the lvloon, i.e. benefic
tendencywill descendfrom one to another and hencethe Moon
is the leastbenefic. If Mars is well relatedto Jupiter,the Moon
or to the Sun, he can do wondersfor a Cancernative. The best
place as far as Saturn is concernedis Capricorn in the company
of Mars or the Moon.

29-30. LEO ASCENDAI{I .. Mercury, Venusand Saturn
are malefics.Auspicious effects will be givin by Mars, Jupiter
andthe Sun. The conjunctionofJupiterand Venus(though
Kendra Kona lords) will not produce auspiciousresults.Saturn
and the Moon are killers who will give effectsaccording to
sssociation. Theseare the effectsapplicableto Leo ascendant.
Notes : Just as the Sun is noted as a killer for Cancer
ascendant,the Moon is similarly classifiedas a killer for Leo
ascendantas she is the lord of the l2th house. This killer-role
has not barred the Moon from becominga Yogakarakaor an
auspiciousplanet for Leo ascendant as per our experience.
Saturn's adverse role is becauseof two plime reasons*firstly
he is a sworn enemy of the ascendantlord and secondlyhe is the
7th lord apart from being the 6th lord. Mercury's rolc is

Notes : Mercury ruling the ascendantand the l0th house

There is no hint in the text about Saturn'srole. By virtue of
the 5th lordshipand good relationship with the ascendantlord
Mercury, he will prove auspicious, But the staindue to 6th

Notes : Although Venusis the ruler of the asiendant,he
owns 8th as well, and hence the sage term him as neutral,
Dire malefic is Jupiter, the lord of the 3rd and the 6th. The

duc to Nabhasa yogas ctc, be atso known which I natrate as
under.
Notes: The good disposition, bad dispositionand killing
powers of the various pl4pets are assignedby the sageon a
particular understandingof lordships etc. for each of the 12
asccndants.From the current two verses,we take an important
clue about the final role of a planet. To wit, if a planet is
constituent of a favourabteyoga, like, say, Daamini Yoga (one
.of the Nabhasa Yogas), his original malefic tendencyof being
an adverseplanet for a particular ascendant,he will give ihe
cftectsof Daamini yoga and thus will becomea Rajayogakaraka.
Conversely,although a planet assumesgoodrole by lordship,
if he is involvedin a bad yoga,like, say, Sarpayoga(one ofthc
Nabhasayogasagain) there will only be adverseresultsand not
favourable results due to lordship. These causesshould be
properly estimated and effects denoted suitably. A killer is a
killer irrespectiveof his havi'ng becomea Rajayogakarakaor so.
Killer and Yogakaraka should not be mixed togetherin respect
of ono and the sameplanet.

also cause Asubha yoga. One born in Subha yoga wiil be
eloquent,charmingand virtuous whire his counterp-art*ilr u"
sensuous,will do sinful acts and will enjoy (or swall,ow)others,
wealth.
Notes : Subhayogais of two kinds. It canbe formed by
a singlebeneficin the. ascendant. It can arsoue rormeo by-a
beneficin the 2nd and by another simurtancousryin tne ritrr.
obviously the latter subha yoga is still superior. (Needlessto
mentiontbat if the ascendant;2nd and r2th are ,simurtaneously
occupiedby 3 benefics,eventhen Subha yoga of u u.ry gr.ui
order is established.) This yogagivesphysicarbeauty, exce'itent
virtues and eloquent disposition. Though the teit does not
mention, additional _effects	1,! : a happy life, health, wealth,
longevity,fame etc Theseadditionaleffectswill not rurrv .uiuri
by a single ordinary benefic in the ascendant.
A malefic or malefics in these pl{ces will produce
AsubhaYoga or inauspiciousyoga. Each yoga is ln.r.uriini"
malefic. As a result,thc subjectwiil be lipldinous, will indrilge
in unethical and sinful deeds and be 6apableof bracketin-g
others' possessions.While a single malefic may not give sJ
bad results,two or three in suchpositionswilr indeedpioduce
most unfavourableresults,apart from affectinghealth, longevity
etc. adversely.
Needlessto mention that in analysingthe results due to
good or bad combinations,one should take the planet's dignity,
strength, relations with other planets and m"ny ru"tr ottrer
factors into consideration. A mareficyoga can be nuilified by
other compensatingfactors while a good yoga may not be
productiveofexpectedgood results when involved in adverse
circumstances.For example, assume that for an Aquarius
Mercuryis in the 2nd housewhile Jupiteris in the l2th house.It
will be detrimentalto rush to the conclusionthat the ascendant
is surroundedby two benefics,and that subha yoga results will
improve the native. Conversely,this is worse than a typical
AsubhaYoga.
Again take Asubha yoga. Assume Virgo rises .while
saturn is in exaltationin the 2nd and the Sun is in Leo in the

One born in Gaja Kesari yoga will be splendorous,wealthy'
intelligentendowedwith many laudable virtuesand will please
the king.
Notes I The Parasari type of Gaja Kesari Yoga is
constructedon a differentfooting' That Jupiter-Moon should
be in mutualanglesis a normallyacceptedyogaunderthis name'
In my opinion this kind of angularity cannotyield supreme
effects.The caseof mereof Jupiterbeing in exaltationin a lunar
angle can better be known as Pa:rchaMaha PurushaYoga'
spJcificallyHamsa Yoga. In other cas€sthe angularity between
tile two neednot be giventhe nameGaja Kesari' In point of
fact, the Moon-Jupitermutual angular placement is called as
simply KesariYoga, vide Phala Deepika, Ch' 6, sloka 14 etc'

Jupiterbeing in an anglefrom the Moon' This is the common
lype of vogi. Second alternative is : The Moon should be
asbectedby Mercury or Venus or Jupiter while the aspecting
planet is free from debilitation and combustion'

-- 367 of 482 --

Chapter36 369
Kumara Swameeyin a popular Tamit classicnas this yoga
stati'g that the Moon shouldbe increasing(i.e. waxind wbile
Jupiter shouldbe in the 4th or io the l0th from the said Moon.
This comesto pass when a constituent is iu Taurus, pisces,
Aquarius or Sagittarius. To wit, Gaja Kesari yoga is applicable
to only four placements That is, Jupiter shourdbe in Aluarius
while the Moon is in Taurus, or vice versa. Alternativeiy the
Moon shoud be in sagittarius whire Jupiter is in pisces, oi vice
versa. Please note that even cancer is omitted which is
exaltation sign for Jupiter and own sign for the Moon.- In
making such a specific statement, the author of Kumrn
swrmeeyrm must obviousry have possessedan unporailelcd
authority.
Then we come to the Tamil tranelation of krasara Hora
by C.G. Rajan. His version statesthat the Moon and Jupi-ter
should be in mutual angles, but thc Moon should not Lve
Mercury in the 5th from her, nor should she be in aspectto
Mercury so that the Yoga obtainedis not simultaneouslygivcn
annulment. Further the Moon should be free fro.. combwbt
and debilitation.
The sanskrit edition of parasaraHora of sri venkatesu.ra
Press,Bombay,has it in sucha manner making it clear that
Vaidyanatha of Jataka par[iata did take these verses from
Parasara. (In fact many of the Raja yogas given in our current
chapter have been used by other workg like phala Deepika,
Kumara Swameeyam,Sata yoga Manjari, Jataka parijata etc)-.
Coming back to Gaja Kesari yoga given by the Bombay series,
we find that the Jupiter-Moon mutual angularity finds place in
the first kind of yoga as given by vaidyanatha white thi second
versionof vaidyanatha occursin the Bombayseriesin a different
guise. It is statedthere that Mercury aspecting or joining the
Moon, not placedin debilitation nor.being combust causesthie
yoga. In the secondyoga, Venusand Jupiter are not riven any
place.
, However, the two yogasgiven by Vaidyanathaare exactly
identical with the onesgiven in parasara Hora of rhakur prasad
PustakaBhandaredition from Varanasi.
The Chaukambhaedition doesnot differ from our version.

-- 368 of 482 --

370 Brlhat Parasara Hora Sastra
Thus; I have placedall the different versions of Gaja
Kesari Yoga before the reader. Though the name doesnot
deserve any special considerationas for Gaja Kesari yoga, I
would give less importance to the mere angular positionsof
Jupitcr-Moon. From otherformations,we may understandthat
Raja Yoga resul8 will prcvail in tbe following conditions in a
descendiogordor.
l. As given in Kumarr Swameeyam.
2. As given in Chaukambhaedition and our edition.
3. The secondkind of yoga given by Jataka Parijata.
4. The second kind of yoga given by Bombayedition of
ParasaraHora.
But, we do not understandthe basis of C.G. Rajan why
Mercury should not aspectthe Moon or be in the 5th from her.
Contrarily when Jupiter and the MooD are in mutual angles,
Mercury in the 5th from the Moon will be an impetus to
GaF Kcsari rather than becomingan impediment.
Cnja Kesari yoga formed in any of the four manners
tuggcstedabove will give wcalth, fame etc. in the Dasa periods
of Jupiter, Moon and planetsrelatedto them. Therc is also a
school of thought that onc born in Kesari yoga will bc rich in
tbe dasaof Vcnus.

Notes : The l0th house from the Moon or from the
acccndant should coDtain c benefic and be without a malefic
occupation. I{a maleficjoins inthe l0th simultaneously,the
cficacy of the yoga will be void. A pure Amala Yoga gives

7-8. PARVATA YOGA .' Beneficsin angles will produce
Parvatha loga, as the 7th and 8th are vacant or are occupied by
only benehcs. One born in Parvatha yoga will be wealthy,
cloqucnt, charitable,learnedin Sastras,fond of mirtb, famous,

Notes : This yoga is formed at leastin many ways accord;
ing to different cla$ical authors.
l. According to our version, there need be beneficsin
angleswhile the ?th and 8th are unoccupiedor bc in oocupation
by bencfie alonc. Then the yoge formed is known as Parvataa
yogE.
2. The Tamll edition of ParasaraHora (translatedby C.G.
Rajan) has this yoge in two manners : That is, Beneficsin
angles aod 6th and tth. Alternatively beneficsehould be in
anglesand 9th.
3. Thc Sanskrit edition of Sri VenkateswaraPressgivesthis
yoga apin in two forms thus ; (l) As per our version. (2) The
lords of thc ascendantand of the l2th in mutual angles and be
aspectedby friendly Planets. Thesetwo are exactly followed by
Sata Yoga Manjari (English translation by Prof. B. S' Rao).
4. Whereas the Sanskrit text of Sata Manjari Raja yoga
(Hindi translation by Pt' G.K. Ojha) puts it thus : The
dispositorof ascendantlord should be in his own sign or in his
Mootatrikma sign which is identicalwith an aogle or a trine
reckoned from thc asccndant. Phele Deepila exactly describes
this yoga in this very manner
5. Coming to Jateledesa Mlrgl, we find yet another
versiontbus : If the ascendant,4th, ?th and l0th are occupied
by planetswhile the 8th and l2th are unoccupied,Parvata Yoga
oocurs. There is no mention of beneficsor maleficsin angles.

8, Now see Jataka Fari$ts. It hss againtwo forus of
this Yoga. The first one is formed in a manner identical with
one mentioned in the Tamil version of Parasara Hora- The
second type is formed as per the second yop related to tsombay
seriesof ParasaraHora. However, the Tamil version of Jrtrlr
Perijtta (1926 edition by SastraSanieevani Press) bas it as our
reit has.
9. A version of Yavanas forms this yoga thus : The
ascendant,7th and l0th be occupied by benefics. So simplc and
no more pre-requisites. Note the 4th smong anglesis omitted
by Yavanas. Thus therc are 8o Inany varieties of Parvata Yoga.

be in mutual angleswhile the ascendantlord is strong, Kahala
yoga occurs. Alternatively the 4th lord being in his own or
' exaltation sign should be conjunct the lOth lord. In efrect, the
native will be energetic,adeventurous,cunning, endowed with a
.complete army consisting of chariots, elephants, horses and
infantry and will lord over a few villages.
Notes : This yoga is given identically in the other three
versionsof Parasara Hora, yiz. Venkateswara,Chaukamba
and Thakur Prasadeditions. Still others define this in difrerent
ways.
l. The first type of Kahala Yoga according to the Tamil
yersiontraoslatedby C.G. Rajan is formed when the iords of
the ninth and fourth are in mutual anglesas the ascendantlord
is endowedwith strength. The secondtype of yoga mentioned
by him is formed if the 4th lord is in his own signor in exaltation
in conjunction with or in aspectto the l0th lord. The aspoctof
the l0th lord is an addition in the Tamil version whereasin our
version only a conjunction is noted. The native being foolish is

effoctsof Kahala Yoga.
2. Mantreswarahas it entirely differently thus : The
dispositorof ascendantlord's dispositorshouldbe in exaltation
or own sign identical with a trine or angle reckonedfrom the
ascendant. The effects mentioned are : prosperity, nobility,
auspiciousness,	benevolenceand kindness.
3. Jetakadsa Merga mentions it in the same way as per
C. G. Rajan's first type of yoga. Jataka Parijata follows
JetakadesaMarga while it adds the secondversionof Kahala

occupied by a benefic while the ascendant lord is in a good
houscor in exaltation. The cffects attributed by Mantreswara
are : long life, prosperinglike increasingMoon, fame,virtue and
leadership. These are comparable[to what is generallystated'

ln effect, the native will be an astrologer, be a synonymof

Notec : While our vcrsion and that of Chaukambha
mcnlion that the ascendantand the 9th be occupiedby bencfic
planetr, the versionsofSri VenkateswaraPress,Thakur Prasad
PustakaBhandar and C. G. Rajan stipulate that maleficsand
not benefics should bc in the ascendantand the 9th. Jrtatr
PrrlStr has tbe sameview as given by the latter group requiring
nrlcfics in the 9th and in the ascendant.
That it is bcnefics that should be in the ascendantand the
9th is obviouslycorrect as three groups are selectedby parasaa
forthis yoga, thus : Benefics in the first group, rnatefics in the
secondgroup and both (i.e. mixed) in the 3rd group.

formed. If the 4rh, 9th and 8rh with reference to itre-eign
occupicd by the 7rh lord are occupied by bcneficr, Hara
yoga is obtainable. Brahma yoga is generatedif, counted from
the ascendant lord, beneficsarein the 4th, lOth and lith

lcarned and endowed with wealthand sons.
.Notes: There areactually three different yogasgivenin
the present two verses. These are Hari Yoga, Hara yoga
and Brahma Yoga. This representsthe trinity of Hindu Gods
and hence is known as Trimurthi yogasjointly. Someinterpret
this as one yoga knowing it as 'Hariharabrahmayoga' which
is howeverincorrect.
For formation of Hari Yoga the 2nd lord's position is
to be noted firstly. From the said position of thc 2nd lord,
eachofthe 2nd, l2th and 8th be occupiedby beneficsindividu-
ally. Seethe chart on the next page.

In the above case, the 2nd lord is Saturn. Note from

37. LAGNADHI YOGA .. Should beneficsbe in the Zth
and the 8th counted from the ascendant and be devoid of
conjunction/aspect of malefics, Lagnadhi yoga is produced
making onea greatperson,learnedin Sastrasand happy.
Notes : Sage Parasara does not include the 6th house
from the ascendantfor Lagnadhiyoga. Only two housesare
suggested,viz. the 7th and 8th from the ascendant.Tbis
is so given in the versionsof Chaukamba,Sri Venkateswara
Press, Thakur Prasad Pustaka Bhandara and C G. Rajan as
well. The last three versions have an additionaf condition
that the 4th house from the ascendant should at the same
time be vacant. In Chandradhi yoga, the sagehas included
the 6th house, seech.37infra,
After a study of the various texts, we can conclude to
the followirg effect : The 6th, 7th and 8th be occupied by
benefics in any manner, i.e. the three bencfics, viz, Jupiter,
Mercury and Venus may be disposed in one, two or three
housesin 6th, 7th and 8th. No other maleficshould be in these
housesnor aspect the occupants.The 4th from the ascendantor
from the Moon. as the casemay be, shouldremainunoccupied.
Then Adhi yoga is obtained. The beneficsmentoniedshould
also be free from combustionand debilitation. If the yoga is
formed in the above conditions, the native will Ue nighly
learned, wcalthy and be among the most suprememen on
the earth.
The best Adhi yoga is, however, with Mercury in the 6th,
Jupiter in the 7th and Venusin the gth house.

pair of Atmakaraka and Putrakaraka and on the other hand
the natal ascendant lord and the 5th lord be considered.
Tbe effects due to such association will be full, or a half
or I quarter accordingto their strengths.
Notes : Raja Yogas giving status can be tbrmed with
Karakamsa Lagna as the reckoningpoint. Similarly the natal
ascendantis also another centerwherefrom such yogasemanate'
(Karakamsa Lagna is the Navamsa occupied by the Atma
Karaka planet.)
If Karakamsa ascendantis oeing consideredin eval-
uation of Raja yogas, the status of Putra Karaka is also
to be taken into account. Here Putra Karaka is Chara
Karaka. He is the 6th in statusin the Atma Karaka scheme,
as eiplained in slokas13-17 of ch. 32 supra. On the other
hand ifnatal ascendant is being consideredthe 5th lord from
natal ascendantshould also be scrutinized in terms of dignity,
so that the real clues to the yoga are made out rightly. The
Sth tord has been given a very important position in the analysis
of Rajr Yoges by the sagedquating hin with the 9th lord
or evenmore, vide stokas33 and 34 of the current chapter.
We shall now take an expandedclue of the two hints
given in tho present verses about the evaluation of Raja
yogBs.
There are certain Raja Yogas formed with reference
to Karakamsaascendant, Atma Karaka's position in the Rasi
chart, Amatya Karaka, Upapada,Arudha pada etc.-so to say
in the Jaimini style-as can be seen in our present text. For
cxample takc the rule given in sloka 22 of the current chapter
where it is stated that Atma Karaka in benefic's Rasi or
Navamsa will make one wealthy. In the chart given in
ch. 29 (sloka l-3), we have Atma Karaka Moon in Jupiter's
Navamsa. So as per the rule the native should becoms
rich. To strengthenthis argument,we find Jupiter in exalta-
tion. Putra Karaka (Chara scheme)for the gid horoscope
in the Sun. He aspects the ascendant. In the Navamsachart,
the Sun is placed in the 4th from Atma Karaka. All these
indicate that 'the native should be wealthy. If Putra Karaka
(Chara) and Karakamsa Lagnaare not well related,the yogas
relatedto that schemewill be futile.

Next take the natal ascendantlord and the 5ti lord from
the natal ascendant. In assessingthe Raja yogasstrengthralated
to the natal ascendant, the strength'and relationship between
thesetwo lords should be correctly understood. In the exampte
chart cited aboVe,the 5th lord is Jupiter who is exaltedand is
cndowedwith a Shadbalaof 9,32 Rupas and Mars 7.32 Rupas.

and the 5th lord from natal ascendant with the lord of the
natal ascendantitself.

and the sth loid exchange their sigus or if Atrna karaka
and Putra Karaka (Chara) are in the ascendant,the 5th,
exaltation sign, own sign or own Navamsa m aslrcct to a
benefic, Maha Raja yoga is produced. The native so born
will be famousand happy.
Notes : An exchange between the ascendant lord and
the 5th lord will bestowa supremeRaja yoga on the native.
For example in the caseof a Pisces-born,Jupiter in the 5tb
and the Moon in the ascendant.
In the second stage,the Atma lkraka and Putra Karaka
(Chara) are brought in the picture. They can be jointly in
the 5th or in the ascendant(or in Karakamsa Lagna and
the 5th from there) or separatelyin thesc places. Alternatively,
both ofthem should be in their respective exaltationsigns,
or in own signs, or in own Navamsasand be related to a
benefic by aspect. In this respect, the horoscope of Mrs
Gandhi will serve us with a perfect exapple. Her chart can
be found with reference to sloka 50 in ch. 24 supra. The
Atma Karaka is Saturn (21" 50') while Putra Karaka is Mercury

ant is also known as Arudha Pada,vide ch. 29 supra.) Being
placedso, Venus must be related to the Moon or Jupiter by
aspect/association.
Taking the examplechart given in ch. 29, we find Venus

Notes : Though mid-day and mid-night are denoted in
the translation for Dinardha and Nisardba a clarification is
cssentialin regard to the implicationsof these.Mid-day simply
denotes12 Noon while mid-night zero hour as per commou
use. But what the sage implies is somewhat diffcrent.
Dinardha means half of the day while Nisardha meanshalf of
the night, keeping in mind the Sun rise and Sun setar a given
place. ,The versehas a yoga to indicate that if there is a birth

-- 395 of 482 --

Chapter 39 397
within an hour of the said Dinardha or Nisardha, the native
will be a king. I shail illustratethis with a practicalcase.
Take for instancea birth on l5th February 1947 at
Jodhpur 73 E 2 and 26 N lg. The local sun rise is ai 063g hrs
and sun set at 1749 hrs. Hence for this latitudeand date,
the dayduration is llh llm and night duration l2h49m,
Divide the day duration by two to get Dinardhawhich indicates
5h 35m. similarlydividingnightduratioo by 2 we get Nisardha
as 6h 24m. Add 5h 35m to sun rise which wilr give harf the
day duration. Thus by adding 5h 35m to Otr lgm, we get
I2h l3m. Similarly in the case of night, the nigbt durati-on
of l2h 49m be halved and the figure'arrivedat is tb be added
tosun set. Thus weget Oh l3m (i.e. 13 mlater thanthe
usualmid-night).
From the abovewe may understandthat by simply taking
t2 noonas mid-dayand 0 hour as mid-nightit witt noiser". oui
purposein the contextofthe yogasuggestedby the sage. Need-
lessto mentionthat LMT is to be usedfor thesecalcuLtions.
Uttara Kslanrita has two yogas in this respect, viz.
Koteeswarayoga and Lakshadhikariyoga(vide crr 4, sroka30;.
Accordingto its author if therebe a birth within 2 ehatikas(i.e.
4E minutes as against parasara'smention of 60 minutesj of
Dinardhaand Nisardha,a king is born who will conquer his
enemiesand observe religious rules of conductand be learned.
fie further adds that if in the saidcasean exaltedplanet is i:i the
2nd house,in aspectto anotherexalted planet,a Koteeswarais
born' If the aspectigplanet is in its own house(insteadof being
in eraltation) the nativewill then be only a Lakshadher*orul
Sufficeit to say that there will be relatively less riches in the
secondcase.

Here we must note the implied difrerencebetweenthe four
lords ruling the various angles. The angular lords are powerful
and more importint in the ascendingorder. That is, the 4th lord
is more powerful than the ascendantlord, the ?th lord is so
againstthe 4th lord, and the l0th lord is the most powerful
among the four lords. So the efrectswill also increase in thc

places,if in Uttamamsahe had done so in the past births as
well, if in Gopuramsahe rvill perform sacrificialrites, in simha-
sanamsahe will be mighty, truthful, bc a conquererof his senses
and will concentrateonly on the SupremeSpirit giving up all
religions, if in Paaravatamsahe will be the greatesof ascetics,
if in Devalokamsa he will be an ascetic holding a "udgei	(qTS) or a religiousmendicantthat has renouncedail mundane
attachEentsand carrying three .long staves tied togetherin his
right ha-nd(filEfq) and if in Brahmalokamsahe *,iil perform
Aswamedha yaga (Horse sacriftce,)and will attain the state of
Lord Indra (god of gods). If the 9th lord is in lravatamsathe
personborn will be a synonym of Dharma or virtues just as
Lord Sri Rama and Yudhishtira (the eldestof pandavas).

-- 407 of 482 --

Chapter 4l
Notes : The 5th lord has beenpsed in spiritual and mate-
rial planesas well. Whereasthe 9th lord is solelyrelatedto onc's
spiritualachievementsas could be seenby the treatment given
by MaharshiParasarain the above5 slokas.
The word Tridandi hasbeen translated as above in the
contextof relatingthe native to a Sansyasias these slokas
exclusivelyconcentrate on the spiritual achievementsof the
native. 'Tridandi'alsomeansone who obtainedcommandover
mind, speechand deed. Without 'TrikarandSuddhi' or purity
of thesethree it will not be possibtefor one to achieve Oiuinl
bliss.One who thinks bad in his mind though good in the other
two spheres,viz. speechand actions cannotbe calleda pure
character.Or one who.thinks of good and speakssimilarly but
actsin a contrary manner cannot be a successfulspiritualist.
Lastly one who speaksund'esirablewords though good in think-
ing and actingcannotalso reach self realisation. Hence it is
evident that one should be a 'Tridandi' or endowed with
Trikarana Suddhi, -so that he locatesthe Almighty at every
point of spaceand time.
We haveso far seen that 5th and 9th lordsare primarity
'realth givers. The sagealsodenotesthe 5th and 9th lords as
lords of 'Lakshmi sthanas'.Lakshmi though normally means
wealth,furtherconveysa meaningsplendour (our lustre). Tt i,
relatesto dlvine splendour acquircd by a personthrough his
iiiritual merits.If a personis splendorous,ive seein him what
ii called Brrhma Varchrs or the splendour making him look
lite God, free from any material attachment.I; this context
pe cannot but recall great personageslike Rama Krishna
ftrama Hamsa, Maharshi Ramana, Sankaracharyasof various
prdersand periods, Sivananda and so on aitd so forth. In all
these cases,the 5th and 9tt lords and 5th and 9th houses
enabledthem earn that splendour.The wealth they earned is
such that it cannot be exhausted even after many centuries,
i e. divine status.

28. ANGULAR AND TRINAL LORDS RELATED : Tho
anglesare known as Vishnusthaana	(i.e. housesof Lord Vishnu)
while the trines are called Lakshmi sthaanas(i.e. houses oi
409

-- 408 of 482 --

410 Brihat Porasara Hora Sastd
Lakshmi). If the lord of an angle establishesrelationshipwith a
trinal lord, a Rajayogawill obtain.
Notes : The 4 houses,viz. the lst, 4th, ?th and l0th are
known as Vishnusthaanas	while the 5th and ahd 9th are l-aksh-
misthaanas.In Hindu mythology, Lakshmi is a consortof Lord
Vishnu,the supremegod.A relationshipthus betweenan angular
lord and a trinal lord is capableof causinga superiorRajayoga,
just as bne having the blessingsof Sri Vishnu and His consort
Lakshmiwill be endowedwith permanentwellbeing.
The kinds of relationship betweenplanets that will be
favourableare :
l. An exchangebetweenthesetwo tords.
2. Mutual aspectsbetweenthesetwo lords.
3. Conjunctionof thesetwo lords.
4. Mutual angularplacementexistingbetweenthesetwo.
5. Mutual trinal placementbetweenthesetwo.
The first three kinds of relationshipsare more powerful
while the last two cannot be equally powert'ul but in a lesser
degree.
A sixth kind of relationshipcan also be extendedin this
contextto Navamsa positionsthoughI have no specificciassic
sanctionfor this. For examplein a Capricornian'scase, Mars in
the Navamsaof.Venusand Venusin that of Mars will confer a
superiorRaja yoga. This form of relationship will be eqally
superior like the first 3 relationships mentioned by me in thc
earlier paragraph.
After seeingsuch a relationship between an angular lord
and a trinal lord, their dignities like Parijataetc. will haveto bc
Eeento dccidethe extent ofeffects due as could be seen in the
following six verses.

. 29.34 EFFECTS OF DIVISTONAL DIGNITIES OF THE
TWO PLANETS SO RELATED .' Should an angular lord
and a trinal lord having sucha relationship(vide above slokas)
be in Parijatamsa,the native will be king and will protect men,
if Uttamamsahe will be an excellentking endowed with eleph-
ants,horses,chariotsetc , if in Gopuramsahe will be a tiger of
kings honouredby othcr kings,and if in Simhasanamsa	he wil!
be an emperorruling over the entire earth; with the said Raja-
yogarelationshipof the said planetsin Simhasanamsa	were born
Haiischandra,Manu, Bali, the Firc god (Agni Deva)and many
otlrer emperors. In the present Yugaso born is Yudhishtira(or
Dharma Raja of Maha Bharata). Salivahana'sbirth and that of
otherswill qlso comewith thisyoga. With theseplanetsso related
and in Paaravatamsa,	Manu etc. were born. The Incarnationsof
Lord Vishnu took placewhen the said planets,beingso related,
uere in Devalokamsa;and in BrahmalokamsaLord Brahma
and in Iravatamsathe SwayambhuManu (the first of the 14
Manus identified as the second creator who produced the
Prajapatis and to the said Manu the code 'of laws yiz. Manu-
smriti is ascribed)wereborn.
Notes : The two planets,viz. anangularlord and a trinal
lord with such a relationship, should be simultaneouslyin
Parijatamsa.One in Parijatamsaand the other in a still higher
Amsa will yield still better effects.The roader can intelligently
manipulatethe effectsac,cordingto such Am'sas.
When studyingthese slokas,we reacha crucial point as
to the period of Parasara. There a1e baselessarguments that
Parasara,author of Brihrit Parasara Hora, could not be a sage
that hved thousandsof yearsago; bur a very recent author tnat
shouldhavelived after Varaha Mihira, Bhattotpala, Kalyana
Yarma and so on and so forth. This misconception does not
4 l l

-- 410 of 482 --

4t2 Brihat ParasaraHora Sastra
deservean answerat all and is worth beingbrushed asideas an
idle gossip. The holdersof suchopinion may advancea million
argumentsin their own favour. Our query to them is: which
exponentreferred to the horoscopicpositionsof Lord Vishnu,
Harischandra,Manu, Bali Chakravarthi,Agni Deva,Swayambhu
Manu and last but not the least the Creater Brahmatrimself?
Is it humanlypossible, but for a sage, with divine contacts,
to producecombinationsexistingin the sacred horoscopesof
Vishnu, Brahmaetc.?Also note with specificattentionthe state-
ment of Parasarathat "Dharma Raja (the eldest son of king
Pandu, of Maha Bbarata)of the present oge,has this yoga".
Does this not stand as an indisputabletestimony of Parasara
having lived in the Maha Bharataera ?
Yet, another clue about Parosarais servedwhenin the
abovelineswe find his prediction that Salivahana and others	'"will be born" with this yoga. The verb used is bhavita in
future tense. That conveysthat Parasarawas a predecessorof
Salivahanaand not a successorof Bhattotpalaetc.
MaharshiJaimini,author of PoorvaMimamsaand propag-
ator of Jaimini Astrologywasa discipleof Parasara.If Parasara
lived in the lTth century,what aboutJaimini ?
Specificattentionof the reader is drewn to the statement
of Parasarain ]sloka 32above,to the effectthat "in the present
Yuga" Dharma Raja is born with sucha yoga.This is an ample
proof that our sagewas in Maha Bharata time and was the
illustriousparentof illustriousVedaVyasa.
Lastly,the following popular quotation enlists Parasart
amongthe l8 exponentsof Jyotisha:

sstrology.

2-3. O Brahmin, for the benefit of mankind I narrate
methodsof ascertainingloogevity,as knowing longevityis diffi-
cult evenfor gods. Many exponentshave laid down various
pethods of longevitycalculations.Following is the summaryof
suchschoolsof thoughts.
Notes : Slokas 2-15 dealwith Pindayu systemof longevity
calculations.After dealing with translation of these14 slokas,
the entiresystemof Pindayu is beingfully explainedby me with
a practicalexampleso that,the readerfollows the calculations
involvedthoroughly.

Basedon the sage'sinstructions,we may device the follo-
wing simpleand commonformula to know the numberof years
contributed by any of the 7 planets.(All concernedlongitudes
should be convertedinto decimals. The minutesand secondsbe
also considered.For example,211 32'49" is converted into
21.347 degreesfor easy calculation.) The formula to find out
the basicplanetarycontribution is :
. l. If "d" is lessthan 180o,then "c"
- f - ( d x f + 3 6 0 )
, 2. If "d" is abovetgo''"'- I 3*

Where "d" is distancebetween the ptanet's deepexalta'
tion degreeand its actual placement;"f" is the full number
of yearsgrantable by the planet-and 'c' is the basic years
actuallygrantedby it due to its placement.
Take Sati.rrn'scaseas an exarnple. He can at bestcontri-
bute 20 years. In the horoscope under evaluation, he is
223.1613degreesaway. froin his deep exaltation (Libra 20').

2. Sahu Kshetra Hrrana : If a planet is in its enemy's

third. An exceptionis that a retrograde planet, although
placedin inimical sign,doesnot incur this liability. 'Vakrachara'

accordingto the planetbeingin l2th, llth, l0th,9th, gth and
7th. These are for maleficplanetswhite a beneficin this con-
nection loses only half of what is notcd for a malefie. The
Moon is ever a benefic for longevity calculations, as. per
Maharshi Parasara. (Mercury although joining a malefic be
treated as a benefic only, lbr all longevitycalculations.) We
find herethat thereis harmonicprogressionin thesedeductions
and hencewe ought to havea scientificand logical approach to
the quantunrof correction,ratherthan resortingto a flat check
arbitrarily. There is no justificationin straightawayeliminating
the whole,for example,for a maleficin the l2th not giving heed
to his actualdegreewiseplacement.It.should be full at the l2th
bhavaendingpoint, poroprtionatelylesson the l2th cusp and
still lesseron thc beginningpoint of l2th bhava or Ilth bhava
ending point. That is, starting with a l00f lesson the l2rh
bhava ending we gradually arrive for a50/" reductionat the
point where the llth bhava ends.. Thus it will be one sixth
reduction at the ond of 7rh bhavawhile it will be l/7th at the
beginaing of the 7th bhava (or end of the 6th bhava). The
reductionobtainedby this methodshould bc half in the case of
a benefic(i.e. Jupiter,"Vdnus,Mercury and the Moon). With-
out going through any difficult process,for each bhava, a
common formula is given with which one can rectify the basic
contributionsof a planet io one of thesehouses.
Thc formula is :
(14-House) - (oe+tsL) :loss of years
(DP:Distance of planet from bhava start; BL:Bhava
length and 'House' is the bhavaoccupiedby the planetunder
re{tific8tion.
To understand this forftula, we will rectify Saturn's
contribution He is in the 8th bhava and hence attracts
tbis reduction. He is in Gemini 3-9-41 whilethe 8th house
beginsin Taurus at 15-48-15and endsat 15-47-38in Gemini.

Saturn is 12.3979years. He is l7,3i72degreeraheadofthc
8th bhavabeginning. Thcrefore,his reduction is :
12 3979 :2.2869 years
Thus, on accdunt of Vyayadi Harana, Saturn entailsa
check of 2.2869 yezrs. In the example horoscope, Mercury is
not liablc to this reductionas he is quite prior to tho beginoing
of the 7th bhava. others that attract this check arc : Thc sun,
the Moon, Venus, Mars and Jupiter. The figures for these
planetsbasedon the presentformula are :
Venus (7th bhava)
The Sun (7th bhava)
The Moon tTth bhava)
Satqrn (8th bhava)
.Vlars (9th bhava)
Jupiter (lOth bhava)
4. Kroorodaya Harana : Only malefics(i.e. Saturn, the
S,rn and Mars) entail this check if in the ascendant.
Mercury,though joining a natural maleficwill not be liable to
this reduction. We do not requirethis rcductionto any planet
in the example horoscope, as there is nonein thg ascendant.
Here the ascendantmeans the area betweenthe startingand
ending points of the sign rising. To find out this reduction,
tte ascendentalcusp in degrees, minutes and seconds be
,multiplied by the number of basicyearsdonatedby the malefic
concernedand divided by 21600. The divider is 21600as these
are the total minutes of arc in the zodiac. The figure so arrived
should be reduced from the said malefic'sbasiccontribution.
However, if a beneficaspectsthe said malefic, reduce only balf
of the figure so suggested
5. We have thus seenfour typei of reductions. At every
stage the reduction should not be done instantaneously. After
obtaining the reduction figures, whereverpermitted,check up
if there is more than one reduction for one and the same planet
under various headings. The following may be rememberedin
this connection.
(a) If a planet attracts more rnan one rednction, thc
highest reduction is only to be done ignoring the orhers. For

Not only the planets, but the asbcndantalso grantsa

In case the Navamsa Lagna lord is stronger than his
cotrnterpart,a different computationis to be rcsortedto, thus.
Count from Aries till you rcacha sign beforcNavamsaLagna.
In the case under study, the NavamsaLagnalord, Moon, is
strongerthan the ascendantlord. Hencewe cqmpute Navamsa

Sun as per rule 3 (i.e. Vyayadi Harana). Hence his final
contributionturns to be 11.7095years (ie. basicyears minus
Satru kshetra Harana). In the matter of Vyayadi Harana
(rule 3) there is no other bhavawherethereis more than one
planet.
Though the Moon has not lost on account of rule 3
(VyayadiHarana),sheis liableto reduction on account of her
combustion(rule l). Thus rvhenher basiccontribution(24627,
is halved,sheis left with a net donationof l2 3124years.
Except the Sun, no other planet is in enemy'ssign. So,

canbe exterrdedto planetarylongitudes.The basiccontributions

suggestfurther corrections for Amsayu, viz. to increasethree-
fold the contribution of a planetin exaltationor in own house
and double the contribution if the contributor is in his own
Navamsaor in own decanate. If doubling and trebling is
warranted, only trebting be done. In caseof reductionsalso,
only halvingis to be doneif both halvingand reducinga third
are required. That is how the final life span of men be
urderstood.

33-40. OTIIER CLUES TO LONGEVITY : O excellent
of the Brahmins,I give you details of other methodsin the
matter of longevityas under : This is basedon the positionsof
the ascendantIord, 8th lord, Saturn,the Moon, natal ascen{ant
and Hora ascendant(Hora Lagna). Thesesix are groupedinto
threegroupsthus : the lords of the ascendantand of the 8th
on the one hand, Saturnand the Moon on the other hand,and
tbe natal ascendaotand Hora ascendanton yet the other hand,
Out of a group,if the two are in movable sign/signslong life is
denoted. One in fixed sign and the other in a dual sign will
also bestowlong life. One in movable aign and the other in
fixed sign will give medium life. If both are in dual signthen
againmediumlife will be obtained. Short life is denotedif one
is in a movablesign as the other is in a common sign,or if both
are in fixed signs. The type of life denoted by three or two

-- 429 of 482 --

Clnpter 43 431
groups be only considered.lf thc threegroupsdenotedifferenl
scales,then the one indicated by the pair of natalascendant
'and Hora ascendan,tbe only considered. In case of thrce
differentindications if the Moon ls in the ascendantor the Zth,
tben the one indicated by Saturn-Moonpair will only come to
pass.
Notes: Three groups are considcredherefor this system
of longevitycalculations. Following are the thrce groups, each
€roup consistingtwo of the six.
Ist group-natal ascendantlord and 8rh lord from the
ascendant.
2nd group-Saturn and the Moon.
' 3rd group-natal ascendantand Hora Langa. (For Hora
I:gna, seep. 63).
Thus two planets in one group, two planetsin another
group and two ascendantsiu yet another group are selected.
Now their positions will denote the basic longevity. Note the
position of eachof the constituentin eachgroup thus :
l. Long life: If both the constituentsare in movablesigns
(jointly or separately),long life will cometo pass. Onc in fixed
sign and another in a dual sign will also give samescaleof
longevity.
2. Medium life : One in movable sign and anotherfixed
sign will givemediumlife. Both in dua! signswill alsogive same
effects.
3. Short life : One in movable sign and anotherin dual
sign will indicatc short.life. Both of them in fixed signswill
produceagainshort life.
Thus, all the six possible positionsof a pair are covered.
lVhich group is to be consideredfor arriving at life spanand
in wbat circumstances	be understoodthus.
4. Out of the three groups, the scaleof span(viz. Iong,
medium and short) indicated by two or threebe considered.
Suppose two groups indicate medium life while another
sbort life, then take mediumspanas.thebasicone. Alternatively
if three indicate identical scales,i e. Iong, short or medium,
cclnsiderthat as the case may be. It is also possiblethat one
group denoteslong life, another medium life and yet another
short life. In that casefollow point 5 given belbw.

5. If 3 groups denote variable spans,the group of natal
ascendantand Hora ascendantwill havc a say on the indication.
Whatever this pair denoteswill be the basicspanin caseof
threedifferent indications.
6. Rule 5 hasalsoan exception,thus. That is, in the case
of three differentindications(i.e. onc long life, anothermedium
fife and yet anothershort life), seethe positionof the Moon in
the natal horoscope. lf she is in the ascendantor in the 7th,
then the indication given by the pair of Hora-natalascendants
be ignored and the indication of Saturn-Moon be alone
considered. lf the Moon is neither in the ascendantnor in the
7th, then follow the indicationof }Iora-natal ascendants	as given
in rule 2 above.

The indicationhas to be selectedas per rules4 to 6 givcn
in the notesfor slokas33-40.
We will now work out the basiccontribution of longcvity
for the same example as given for Pindayu calculations' The
chart may be understood from Pindayu example, while Hora
Lagna is Taurus 20' 32' 12".
The first group-ascendant lord is in a movablesign and
the 8th lord is also in a movableiign. Hencc long life.
The second group-Saturn and the Moon are respectively
in dual sign and movable sign. Hence short life.
The third group-Hora Lagnaand the qatal ascendant&rc
both in fixed signs. Again short life.
Two groupsindicateshort life. Hencewe are left with no
dilemmabut to selectthe indicationsgiven-by thc twogroups,
i.e. short life. Two pairsindicateshort life, 'hence36 years will
be the basiclongevity.
This basiclongevity will have to be rectiGedfurther as per
the instructionsgiven in the following verses.

Notes : The 3rd houseis alsoa houseof longevityas it is
thc 8th from the 8th. The 2nd house-l2rh from the 3rd-and
thc 7th house-l2th from the 8th-are two principle Maraka
houses. Thc lordq of these houseswill also acquire such
qualitieogiving life or taking away life.

tbc 2nd and the 7th lords are all known as Marakas. The major
and sub periodsof theseplanetswill bring deathon the native

Chapter 44 441
Notes : The 2nd an<l 7th are denotedas Maraka houses.
but the 2nd is givena more important placeto kill than the 7th
house. For the 2nd houseacquiresan additional qualification of
beingin the 7th from the 8th house.Thus, the 2nd is l2th from
the 3rd, and 7th from the 8th.
If thereiq a maleficin the 2nd or in the 7th, he will be a
prime killer while a beneficwill not be so. The Dasa periods of
suchplanetswill inflict death.

6-7. The Dasa of a beneficplanet related to the l2th lord
may also inflict death. End may descendon the nativein the 8th
lord's Dasa. The Dasaof a planetwhich is an exclusivemalclic
(i.e. first-ratemalefic)may also causedeath.
Notes : The l2th houseisalsoa houseof death,for it is
the terminal house. Malefics related to 2nd, 3rd, Tth and 8rh
will causedeathwhile or not a beneficrelatedto l2th will do so.
The Dasaof a malefic,whelheror not he is a lord of oneof these
houses,will also prove harmful for spanof life. Ho\wever,for
Saturn,a dilferentapproachis recommended.
The rules given are just general and are hints to decide
deathgivers. The life spanshould be ascertainedthrough other
Ayurdaya catculations, and the exact dasaperiodsbe dccided
only later on. Simply sayingthat the 2nd lord's dasawill bring
in death and so on and so forth will be a misnomer. The sage
suggeststhat the occupantsof the 3rd,alsowi[ causedeath..Thus
thc 8th and the 3rd, though known as housesof longevity,are
gimultaneouslycapableof causingdeath. For the information
of the reader,the Maraka planetsin the ascendingare : occu-
ponts ofor lords of l2th, 3rd, 8rh, ?th and 2nd. The lords/
gccupantsof 6th and llth are seco'ndgrade killers. The last
group consistsof occupants/lordsof 5th, 9th, l0th, 4th and Ist.
They are the least rnarakas. However, thesecan also become
Marakasdependingon the cluesgiven in slokas l5-2t infra.

15-21. I furtber mention about the Maraka planets.
One born with short lifs combinations may face death in the
Dasadenotedby Vipat star (3rd from birth star);one of medium
life may die in the dasadenotcdby Pratyak star (5th from birth
star). .In the dasa denotedby Vadha star (7th from birth star),
	-one with long life may obtain his end. The dasaof the lord of
22nd decanateor the one of 23rd, 3rd, Sth or ?th asterismsmay
also cause death. The lords of the 2nd and l2th counted from
the Moon sign may bring death,this is true when the said ruler
is a maleficand if he be a beneficthere will be (only) disease
(but not death). Death may cometo passin the dasaof the 6th
lord and in the sub periodsof 6th/8th/l2th lords. Should there
be many Marakas (endowedwith the power of killing) and be
strong, therc will be diseases,misbriesetc. in the respective
major and sub periods. Thus theseare Marakas (as above)and
are primarily relatedto descenddeathupon the native. Accor'
ding to thcir dispositiousthere may be dcath or difficulties.

Notes : The Maraka power of a planet may be correlated
to the spanof life arrived by other calculations. If both
coincide therewill be death. If thereis a variation, therc will
not be deathbut difficultiesequalto deathlike miseries,diseases,

AVASTHAS : I now tell you of the avasthasviz' Sayana,
Upavesana,Netrapani,Prakasana,Gamana, Aagamana,Sabha,
Aiama, Bhojane, Nrityalipsa, Kautuka and Nidra, and the
chesthasof suchavasthas. Note the numberof the stars([rom
Aswini). occupied by thc planet for which Avastha is to be
calculated.Multiply that number by the numbcr denoted by
the planet (Sun l, Moon 2 etc.). The figurc so arrivedat be
again multiplied by the number of ' Navamsa the planet
is in. Add to this the number of birth astcrism,the number
of ghatis of birth and the number o[ signs the ascendant
gained from Aries. This figure be divided by 12 and the
iemainderwill indicatethecorrespondingAvasthaof the planet'
The sub state in the said Avastha can be found out thus :
Multi2ly the figure denoted by the Avastha concerneo(i c'
Sayanal, Upavesana2 etc) by the samefigureand incrcaseit
by the figuredenotedby the Anka valuc for the first syllablcof
the native's personal name. Dividc the productso obtained
by 12. - The remainderthereof be furthcr increascdby constant
planetary additamdtrts, thus : Sun 5, Moon 2, Mars 2,
Mercury3, Jupiter5, Venus3, Saturn3, Rahu4 (ald Ketu 4)'
(Here the planetmeansthe one for whom the substateis being
known.) The product so arrivedat be divided by 3. In th

Notes: So far narrated are .three differentgroupsof

statusof the ptanetcounted from the Sun (i.e. Sun l, Mercury
4 etc; 'n' denotes the planet's Navamsa position (i.e. I to 9
Navamsas);'a' denotes Janma Nakshatra(or ruling star, i.e. the
one occupiedby the Moon); 'g' denotes the ghati in which birth
took place (i.e. 20gh 2 vigh is 2lgh) and 'r' denotes the
ascendant'sorder counted from Aries (i.e. Cancerd Leo 5, so
on and.soforth).
In placeof 'n' given above, some translatorsinterpretthe
word 'Amsa' as degreeoccupiedby the planetwhich is obviously
not correct. [n this connection, the reader'sattentionis drawn
to Balabhadra's Hora Ratna, ch 3 wherein the author
Balabhadrahimselfgivcs an example for the Sun beingin the
7th Navamsaof Leo and thus he consideredonly 7 as muliiptier.
He hasnot taken in to account the Sun's degree. He quotes
AdhbbutaSegara as his authority for calculationof Sayanadi
Avasthas. It will thus be clear that 'Amsa' is Navamsaand
not degreein this context.
. Also pleasc note that Aagamanavastha(the 6th one) is
known as Gamanechchavastha	by someexponents-
Takc a casenow as an example with the following data.
The Sun in Krittika Nakshatra, 3rd Navamsa of Taurus(i.e in

With the help of remainder3, we count threeAvastnas
from Sayana. This indicatesNetrapaniAvasthafor thb Sun.
Similarly for 9 planets,such Avasthasbefound out. In
a given horoscope,the factors 's', 'g'and 'r' wifl be identicar
for all the 9 planets while factors .s', .p' and .n, will be
variable.
_ After knowing the Avasthas of various planets, we have
to find out the sub state of each Avastha. The foimula for

strengthand weaknessof the planets. In exaltation,the planets
revealeffectsin a pronoundedmannerdue to (good)avasthas.
Notes : If a planetis in good Avasthaand is in Cheshta
(sub state), the good effects will be full. If the sub stateis
Vicheshta,the good cffectsareneutralised. lf the substateis
Drishti, good effectswill be feebly felt. A planet in exaltarion
will give the good effectsdue to a particular Avasthain a fuller
measure.
If a planeris in bad Avasthawith Chesbtaas sub state,
the evil effectswill be less. With Drishti, evil effectswill be
visibly felt. If Vichesbtais sub state,bad effectsare neutralized.
In debilitation, the evil effects due to an Avastha will be
pronounced.
Eachplanetgivesdifferenteffects-goodor bad-according
to the Avastha. No constant evaluationbe madejust with the
nameof an Avastha. This is what is conveyedin the following
